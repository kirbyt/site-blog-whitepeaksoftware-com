wayneeglonbrown posted the comment "would be good to be able to delete one put in in error" in the App Store. This is not the first time someone has asked for this feature or asked the question "how to delete."Â  Good news is this feature already exists. Labor Mate provides 2 ways to delete a recorded contraction. 

One option is to use the swipe delete feature common to many iPhone applications. Simply slide your finger across the item and a Delete button will appear. Touch the Delete button and the contraction is removed. 

The other option is to tap the contraction item. This takes you to a second screen. At the bottom of this screen is a Delete Contraction button. Touch this button to delete the individual contraction.
