[@rsachdeva](http://twitter.com/rsachdeva) asked, "How do you know when someone buys the app?" Of course, he is referring to an iPhone. Here is a list of tools I use to reviewing my daily iPhone sales figures: 

[AppViz](http://www.ideaswarm.com/products/appviz/): AppViz is a brilliant piece of Mac software that allows iPhone developers to download and review their app sales. It also supports ranking and review downloads. AppViz sells for $29.95 (USD) and is well worth the price in my opinion. 

[AppDailySales](http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/): This is a python script that downloads daily sales reports. It's open source and written by yours truly. I have the script setup to run daily on a server. This ensures I never miss a daily report even when I'm away from the computer for a few days. 

[AppSales Mobile](http://github.com/omz/AppSales-Mobile): An open source iPhone application that is great for looking at daily sales when on the road.
