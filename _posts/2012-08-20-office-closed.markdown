The White Peak Software office will be closed from Wednesday, August 22, through the end of September. 

I am leaving for a month long backpacking trip starting on August 22, and I plan to return by the end of September. Unfortunately I will not have Internet access during this trip, which is why the office will be closed. I apologize in advance for any inconvenience this might cause. 

All support emails will be answered in the order they are received once I return. 

If you have lost your license information and need it re-sent, click [here](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/support/licenselookup) and provide the email address used when the order was placed. Your license information will be retrieved and sent to you via email.

An update to this blog will be posted as soon as the White Peak Software office returned to normal operations.
