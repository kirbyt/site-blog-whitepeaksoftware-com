Fall is almost here and it's going to be a busy on for me. Not only will I be heads down trying to finish my upcoming book, I will be speaking at two iOS developer conferences. The first conference is [Voices That Matter](http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/iphonefall2010/) in Philadelphia on October 16 and 17. This will be my first VTM, and I'm very excited to be apart of the event. There are a lot of great talks planned for the 2-day conference. My talk will be on the advantages of writing universal apps for iPad and iPhone. Early bird pricing ends today so register now to save money. Use the discount code PHASPKR to save even more money.

The second conference I'm speaking at this fall is [360iDev Austin](http://www.360idev.com/). It's no secret that 360iDev is one of my favorite developer conferences. I have made numerous friends since attending my first 360iDev last year, and the networking I've done at past 360iDev conferences has help land me paying gigs. My session at 360iDev will be on the fundamentals of iPad programming. This session is intended for anyone just starting out with iPad programming. Earlier bird pricing as already ended for 360iDev Austin but even at the full price of $599, it is money well spent if you are serious about iOS programming.
