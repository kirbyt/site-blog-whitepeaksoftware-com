I'm very happy to announce that [Labor Mate](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/labormate), a specialized stopwatch designed to track a woman's labor contractions on the iPhone and iPod touch, is now available for purchase from the iPhone App Store. 

Labor Mate is an easy-to-use stopwatch for the iPhone and iPod touch that tracks a woman's labor contractions with a simple push of a button.  With Labor Mate you can view the length of each contraction as well as the time between contractions.  You can also view the average length for contractions and the average time between contractions, which is helpful in determining when it is time to call the doctor or head off to the hospital. 

Labor Mate cost $0.99 USD and is available for purchase through the [iPhone App Store](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=293822973&mt=8).
