This weekend was [Voices That Matter](http://voicesthatmatter.com/) Seattle. It was my second time attending VTM and second time speaking. I have to say this latest installment of VTM was even better than the last one in Philly.

My conference weekend kicked off on Friday with a full day workshop learning [Cocos2D](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/). This workshop was full of juicy awesome goodness, and for the first time in my career I feel like I now know how to write a game. In fact I have a new game idea brewing in my head as I type this. [Rod Strougo](http://twitter.com/rodstrougo) and [Ray Wenderlich](http://twitter.com/rwenderlich) did an outstanding job putting together and teaching the full day workshop.

VTM continued to impress for the next two days. Some highlights for me included:

  * [Mike Lee's](http://twitter.com/bmf) keynote. I was especially moved by the part where Mike talked about our wonderful iOS and Mac developer community.

  * Hearing [Graeme Devine](http://twitter.com/zaphodgjd) talk on Game Center and the Art of Addictive Games and getting to meet him. We had some good chats. It wasn't until later I found out [who he really is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Devine).

  * Meeting [Kevin Callahan](http://www.kevincallahan.org/) and getting the one-on-one demo of [Accessorizer](http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html). This app is awesome and does so much to make you more productive in Xcode.

  * And of course catching up with old friends and making new ones (too many to list here).

Thanks to the [VTM organizers](http://twitter.com/vtm_iphone) for putting on a great event, and special thanks to [Chuck](http://twitter.com/chuckdude) for getting me from and to the airport.
