I'm exploring a new iPhone app idea and I need your help. I'm looking for parents who use day care services to answer this [short survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/857YTSY). The feedback will help me decide what features to included as well as whether I should pursue the app idea.

In a nutshell, the app idea is a daycare cost calculator. The app will help parents calculate daycare costs and is ideal for parents who pay different amounts each month.
