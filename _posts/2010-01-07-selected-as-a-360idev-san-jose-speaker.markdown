Yesterday I was having a very good day but around 5:45 pm my day got even better. I received an email from the fine folks at 360iDev that my topic "Building Web Service Powered iPhone Apps" has been selected. Yep, that's right folks. I will be speaking at the upcoming [360iDev San Jose](http://www.360idev.com/) (April 11-14).

I'm very excited about this opportunity for a number of reasons. First and foremost, speaking at the conference gives me a chance to share what I have learned over the recents months about leveraging web services within iPhone applications. I have worked with web services in some form for over a decade now so it's only natural that I would gravitate towards using them in iPhone applications. I also plan to blog more on the topic as I prepare my materials for the conference.

Another reason I'm excited about speaking at 360iDev this spring is I get to attend the conference. I was on the fence about going. I'm already registered for [NSConference 2010 USA](http://nsconference.com/) and I plan to attend this year's WWDC. I actually was planning to email John at 360iDev to ask if there are plans for another event later in the year. 360iDev Denver was such an incredible experience I knew I didn't want to go the entire year without attending at least one event. But before I got the chance to ask about another event this year I received the email accepting me as a speaker. This of course made my decision easy. Heck yeah I'm going in April!

And the final reason I'm excited about this opportunity, 360iDev events are the best. Granted I have attended only 1 and that was last fall, but it was by far the best developer conference I have attended in recent years. And definitely one of the top conferences I have ever attended. I posted [my comments about 360iDev Denver](http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2009/10/13/360idev-denver-a-personal-review/) back in October so I will not repeat myself here. What I will say, though, is if you are an iPhone developer then you should attend 360iDev San Jose. I guarantee you will pick up a trick or two or twelve and best of all you will get to meet other awesome iPhone developers.
