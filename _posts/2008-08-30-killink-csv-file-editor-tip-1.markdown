[![](http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/celleditor.jpg)](http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/celleditor.jpg)Do you have a large amount of text to edit in a single cell? You can edit the text directly in the cell. You could edit the text in the editor line at the top of the edit windows. Both approaches work but it's still a bit cumbersome when editing a large amount of text. The better approach is to use the Cell Editor window. 

To access the Cell Editor window, select the cell to edit then press Ctrl+Enter. This will pop open the Cell Editor window. Or you can press the ellipsis button found at the end of the editor line. Once the Cell Editor window is open you can easily edit the text. You can resize the window making it easier to view and edit the text. And you can even turn on and off word wrapping.
