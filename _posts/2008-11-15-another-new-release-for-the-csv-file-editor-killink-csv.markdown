Even though Killink CSV Editor version 1.13 is only a few hours old, I decided to squeeze in one more new feature resulting in the release of Killink CSV Editor version 1.14.  As always, this is a minor update and is a FREE update for all licensed users. 

**What's New:**

  * Replace All and Count can be restricted to the selected cells.  More information on this new feature is available [here](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/forums/Topic283-12-1.aspx#bm291).
