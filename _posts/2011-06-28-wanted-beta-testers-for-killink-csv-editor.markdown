I posted a new beta for Killink CSV Editor v2 today. The big feature added to version 2 is Unicode support. This means Killink CSV Editor can now read and write not only ASCII files but UTF-8 and UTF-16 files.

If you're a Killink CSV Editor user and you want to live life on the edge, please [download beta 2](http://cdn.whitepeaksoftware.com/downloads/setup-killinkcsv-250.exe), give it a test drive, and send email to _support at white peak software dot com_ if you encounter any issues. Note this build of Killink CSV Editor installs, by default, in a separate directory allowing both Version 1.14 and Version 2.0 to co-exists on the same computer.
