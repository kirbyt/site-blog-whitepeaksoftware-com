I made a somewhat embarrassing mistake. I forgot to post version 1.13 of Killink CSV Editor.  I've been working on version 2 and between that and other things my mind has been elsewhere.  Still no excuse for not getting this version out sooner especially considering that it contains the bug fix for the find and replace feature.  I sincerely apologize to the Killink CSV users out there for this delay. 

With that said, I'm happy to announce the immediated availability for version 1.13 of the Killink CSV Editor. This update is free to all licensed users and contains the following updates: 

  * Fixes the find and replace [bug](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/forums/Topic275-12-1.aspx).

  * Adds the shortcut key Ctrl+Home to move to the top left most cell.

  * Adds the shortcut key Ctrl+End to the move the bottom right most cell.
