title: "Feeling Overwhelmed is an Understatement"

Life has been crazy busy recently. Of course it seems my life is always crazy busy, and just when I think it can't get any more crazy busy, it does. I'm behind on a number of things, and I can't help but feel overwhelmed. Heck, feeling overwhelmed is probably an understatement for how I feel right now. 

This year has been an amazing year for me, work-wise. I reinvented White Peak Software last year as company focused on iOS, and this year is shaping up to be my most exciting and enjoyable year in the company's (almost) 7 year history. But a number of things are suffering as well. Progress on the book is suffering. Product updates are suffering. New product releases are suffering. Even client work is suffering because there's simply no way for me to keep up with the demands. Despite of all this, I feel a bit better this evening after reading a posting from Jeff LaMarche. 

I look up to Jeff, and I'm amazed at how much work he pumps out. I often wonder where he finds the time - not having a two year old in the house probably helps - and I'm convinced he never sleeps. In his posting [Complaining About Success](http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/09/complaining-about-success.html), Jeff mentions "time has become a scarce commodity."

Ah, he is human. He does fall behind from time to time.

While I feel for Jeff, I admit reading his post makes me feel a bit relieved that I'm not alone.

And Jeff, if you are reading this, I plan to stick with the [release then nil](http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/09/dealloc.html) approach. It's the approach I learned when first diving into Objective-C. Old habits are sometimes hard to break.
