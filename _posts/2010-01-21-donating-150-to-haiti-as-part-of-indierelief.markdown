The final sales numbers are in for White Peak Software. $150 was raised by our customers as part of [Indie+Relief](http://www.indierelief.com/). A big THANKS to all who participated. 

Because it is such a good cause I decided to do something a little different. The original plan was to donate all proceeds from the sales on January 20. However, additional processing fees are taken out of each transaction - 30% to Apple and 15% to eSellerate. I decided I will donate the cost of the transaction fees myself. 

Here is a breakdown of sales for the donation:

**Grand Total**
 
 
**$146.48**

I rounded the grand total up to **$150**. The money has been donated to [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/) as part of the emergency relief for Haiti. 

Finally, I want to send a big THANKS for [Justin Williams](http://twitter.com/justin) of [Second Gear Software](http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/) for coming up with the idea and [Garrett Murray](http://twitter.com/garrettmurray) who built the Indie+Relief web site. Both individuals put a great deal of time and effort to make this event happen in just a matter of days.
