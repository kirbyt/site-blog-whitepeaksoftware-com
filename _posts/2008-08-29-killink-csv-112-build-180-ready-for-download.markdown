I discovered a nasty little bug in the routine responsible for loading a file into Killink CSV.  If the file is formatted just right then an infinite loop occurs causing a memory leak and strange access violations.  Once I found the bug I was able to squash it. 

[Download](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv-download.aspx) Killink CSV 1.12 Build 180 for the fix.
