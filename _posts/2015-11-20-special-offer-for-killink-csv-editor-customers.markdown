I recently made the tough decision to [retire][1] Killink CSV Editor. This retirement means new licenses for the CSV editor are no longer available for purchase.

## But what does this mean for existing Killink CSV Editor customers?

Nothing changes. If you previously purchased a Killink CSV Editor license, then you can continue using the editor. And I'm available to answer any questions you might have about the editor.

I do understand some of you may prefer using a CSV editor that is gaining new features and improvements. That's why I'm happy to share with you a nice offer from the makers of [Ron's Editor][3], another outstanding CSV editor for Windows.

## Free Ron's Editor License

Existing Killink CSV Editor customer are eligible to receive a FREE license to Ron's Editor. Claiming the free license is easy as 1-2-3.
