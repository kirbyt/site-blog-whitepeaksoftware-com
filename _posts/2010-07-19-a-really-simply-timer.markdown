title: "A Really Simply Timer"

A friend asked if I would put together a sample iOS app that shows how to display a stopwatch timer like the one used in Labor Mate. It seemed like a fun exercise to break up the night, so I said, "Sure, why not." 

I decided others might find the sample source code useful so I posted the project to [github](http://github.com/kirbyt/SimpleTimer) for all to enjoy. The piece devs might find interesting is the KTStopwatch class. This is a simplified version of the class I use in Labor Mate. It supports wall clock and elapsed time.

The source code is licensed using The MIT License, so do with it what you like. Enjoy.
