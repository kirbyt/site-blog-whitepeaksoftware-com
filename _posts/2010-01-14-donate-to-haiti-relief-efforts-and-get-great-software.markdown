I will be donating all proceeds from White Peak Software product sales on Wednesday, January 20, 2010, as part of the [Indie+Relief](http://www.indierelief.com/) program. The proceeds will be donated to [Doctors Without Borders](http://doctorswithoutborders.org/) to assist with their efforts in Haiti.

## How can you help?

You can help by purchasing one of our products: Labor Mate, Killink CSV Editor, or SMTP Diagnostics. Don't have a need for one of our products? Then visit the [Indie+Relief](http://www.indierelief.com/) website for a list of other independent software companies participating in this Haiti relief program.
