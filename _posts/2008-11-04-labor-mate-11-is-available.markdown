I just received word from Apple that Labor Mate version 1.1 is now available for purchase in the iPhone App Store.Â  I'm sure it will take a bit longer to propagate but existing users should be getting update notices soon. 

This new release includes 2 new features: 

  * Email the contraction log to anyone

  * See the contraction date and time

Users, keep sending me your suggestions and I'll do my best to incorpoate them as quickly as possible.
