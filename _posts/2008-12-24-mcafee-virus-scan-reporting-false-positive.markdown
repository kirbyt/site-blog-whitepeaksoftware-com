It has come to my attention that within the last 24 hours the McAfee virus scanner is reporting that Killink CSV contains the Trojan Backdoor-CEP.  I have triple checked the program files and **there is no virus or trojan in the Killink CSV** program available from the White Peak Software web site. 

I have filled a report with McAfee alerting them of the issue.  Unfortunately there is no good workaround to the problem short of not using McAfee, but I do **not** recommend turning off virus protection for Windows users.  I will provide updates as I get them from McAfee.
