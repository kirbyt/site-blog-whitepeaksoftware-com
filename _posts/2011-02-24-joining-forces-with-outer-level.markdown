I'm very excited to announce a new partnership between [Outer Level](http://outerlevel.com/) and White Peak Software. Outer Level is the maker of great Mac and iOS apps including [LicenseKeeper](http://outerlevel.com/licensekeeper/), [Bullfrog](http://outerlevel.com/bullfrog-mac/), and (my personal favorite) [Knapsack](http://outerlevel.com/knapsack/). Outer Level's success over the last year has left Jon, founder and lead developer at Outer Level, with more work than he can handle by himself. So Jon has asked me to join the Outer Level development team to help out. 

I'm very excited about this opportunity to work with one of the top Mac developer in the community. And while I have a lot to offer Jon and team, I will selfishly be learning a lot from Jon as I help with new development on Knapsack, Outer Level's [travel app](http://outerlevel.com/knapsack/). 

What impact will this have on White Peak Software? None. I will continue working for White Peak Software as I have for the last 7 and a half years (Wow! It's been that long?!). This partnership will, however, reduce my availability for consulting work, but this is a good thing as it fits within my long term goals for White Peak.
