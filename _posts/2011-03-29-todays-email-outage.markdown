White Peak Software suffered a major email server outage earlier today. Server hardware at the hosting provider died a horrible death causing the outage. I believe the outage started around 10:30 am Eastern and continued until almost 8:00 pm Eastern. 

After a few hours and reports of emails bouncing back with "invalid email address" errors, I decided to move the White Peak Software mail server to a new hosting provider. This meant email was once again flowing even while the original hosting provider tried to solve the hardware problems.

Email seems to be stable again. However, if you sent an email to White Peak or me any time today and I have not responded then please resend the email. It's likely the email fell into a black hole.
