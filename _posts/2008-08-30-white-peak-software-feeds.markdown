I have moved the feeds for White Peak Software to FeedBurner.  If you already subscribe to this blog feed then no additional action is needed.  But if you also subscribe to the Announcements feed that is found the Forums then you should update the feed URL.  No worries if you do not update the URL.  You'll still receive the feed. I just won't be able to track it.  That's all. 

Here are the new feed URLs:
