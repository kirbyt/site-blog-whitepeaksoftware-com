Jonathan Kardos has an excellent article on Boston Innovation explaining [how to find a mobile app developer in Boston](http://bostinnovation.com/2010/07/08/how-to-find-a-mobile-app-developer-in-boston/). [NSHappyHour](http://nshappyhour.org) even gets a mention, which is great. But one thing left out of Jonathan's article are national events such as [360idev](http://360idev.com). 

Speaking from personal experience, attending events like 360idev is a great way to not only meet and network with developers but for developers to find work, whether they are looking for a permanent position or contract work. This is one of the many reasons I return to 360idev event after event, and why I will be at the next one in Austin TX on November 7th through the 10th.
