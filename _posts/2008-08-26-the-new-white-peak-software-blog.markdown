Welcome to the new White Peak Software blog. 

I decided it's time to separate [my personal blog](http://www.thecave.com/) from the [company blog](http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/).  When I first started White Peak Software, back in November 2003, I had separate blogs but it was difficult at the time to separate what belonged on the personal blog and what belonged on the company blog.  I tried a number of different tricks including syndicating each blog to the other.  Ultimately I decided to consolidate and use a single blog.  But White Peak Software is a different company today then it was back then. 

Today White Peak Software sells products.  Yes, services are still available but software products are the company's primary focus.  And product specific blog postings don't necessarily make sense on my personal blog.  Hence the start of this company focused blog.
