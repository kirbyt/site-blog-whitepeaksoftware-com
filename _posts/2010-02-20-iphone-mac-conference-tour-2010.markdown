Today is the official start of what I am calling iPhone Mac Conference Tour 2010. Between now and June I will be attending 3 iPhone and Mac developer conferences. My tour beings with [NSConference](http://nsconference.com/), which starts tomorrow, followed by [360iDev San Jose](http://www.360idev.com/) in April and wraps up in June with my first visit to [WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/).

[NSConference](http://nsconference.com/) USA kicks off tomorrow with an iPhone developer workshop followed by 2 days of Mac developer talks and ending Wednesday with 2 additional workshops, one on concurrent programming and the other on insights from [Matt "Legend" Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/). I'm excited about NSConference, not only for the talks but the chance to finally meet a number of people I follow on Twitter. Plus the conference will likely be the kick in the butt I need to get started on my first commercial Mac desktop app.

[360iDev San Jose](http://www.360idev.com/) is April 11 through 14. What can I say about 360iDev that I haven't [already said](http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2009/10/13/360idev-denver-a-personal-review/). It's a great conference. The last one in Denver was one of the best developer conferences I have ever attended. 360iDev San Jose will be a bit different for me though since I will be one of the speakers. My topic will be on using web services with your iPhone apps. Oh, and if you are planning to attend be sure to [register here](http://bit.ly/8UmMI5). You're registration will help me win suite at the hotel.

And what better way to conclude the iPhone Mac Conference Tour 2010 then by attending Apple's own Worldwide Developer Conference ([WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/)). I've never been. This will be my first WWDC. I really wanted to go last year but had a scheduling conflict. Not this year. I have blocked off the entire month of June until the WWDC dates are announced.

So that's my conference tour for this year. I'm really looking forward to each conference. Speaking of, time to head down to the hotel lobby and meet some folks here for #nsconf.
