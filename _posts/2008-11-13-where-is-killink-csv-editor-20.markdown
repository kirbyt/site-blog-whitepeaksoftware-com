I've talked about the next major release for Killink CSV Editor for a long time now and I'm sure the one reader out there is wondering, "Where is Killink CSV Editor 2.0?"  Well, it's coming.  Bet you didn't see that one coming.  Seriously though, I am activity working on version 2.0 of my favorite csv editor.  Version 2.0 is basically a re-write of the previous version which is why it is taking so long to complete.  Unfortunately I can't give a time frame for the release of version 2 but I'm hoping to have the first beta ready sometime soon.  Post a comment to this blog entry or send me an [email ](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/contacts)if you are interested in beta testing Killink CSV Editor 2.0.
