Great news!  As of this morning, December 25, McAfee has resolved the mis-identification issue affecting Killink CSV Editor.  Customers effected by this problem should update McAfee with the latest virus protection update then re-install Killink CSV Editor. 

The re-install of Killink CSV Editor is necessary since McAfee forcibly removed the program file killinkcsv.exe.  Optionally, you may be able to restore the program through the McAfee Security Center but I cannot guarantee this will work since individual configurations of McAfee may be different. 

You can download the latest version of Killink CSV Editor from [here]( http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv-download.aspx).

Sorry for any inconvenience this problem may have caused.  Hopefully it will not happen again.
