Turns out I'm nuts, and I can prove it. Last week a signed a contract to publish a book with Addison Wesley. Justin Williams at [SecondGear](http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/) put it best when he asked, "ARE YOU NUTS!?" Yep, apparently I am. And signing the book contract is my proof.

Kidding aside, I'm very excited about this opportunity to contribute back to iPhone development community, a community that has been extremely helpful to me over the last couple of years. The book is on learning iPad programming. It will focus on the unique aspects of programming for the iPad and will hopefully serve as a launch pad for many new iPad programmer entering the space.

Writing on the book has just begun, and I have a very aggressive 6-month delivery schedule. My life is going to be busier than ever over the next 6 months, but it will be a good busy as this is something I have wanted to do for a long time. So if you don't hear from me much between now and November, you know why.
