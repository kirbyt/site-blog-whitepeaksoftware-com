I'm making an early 2010 New Year's Resolution. I'm going to blog more. There. I've said it. And in a blog posting no less. This entry will haunt me if I do not stick to this resolution. 

I've done a horrible job at blogging since my son was born 20 months ago. This is true for all 3 of my main blog site, my [personal blog](http://www.thecave.com/), this [company/tech blog](http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/), and even the [blog about my son](http://RowanTurner.net). Of course it's not his fault. I blame Twitter. 

I've developed a bad habit. If I can't share it in 140 characters than I don't share it. This is wrong on so many levels, especially since 2009 has been such an important year for White Peak Software, which I will explain in an upcoming blog. 

So with that, you can expect more postings on this blog.
