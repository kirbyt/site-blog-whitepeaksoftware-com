The next release of Labor Mate, the labor contraction stopwatch for the iPhone and iPod touch, is nearly complete. The new release will include a new icon, some changes to the user interface, and some new functionality including being able to delete an individual contraction and adding notes to a contraction. But more importantly are the number of improvements behind the scenes. 

A number of memory leaks have been fixed, and areas such as scrolling have been improved. It's fair to say that this release of Labor Mate is almost a complete re-write of the original. This is a good thing because it will enable me to add new features faster in the future. 

To those of you whom I told the next release would be available two weeks ago, sorry for the delay and thanks for your patience.
