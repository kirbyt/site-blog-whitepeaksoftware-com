Work on the new major release for Killink CSV Editor continues.  It is taking me much longer than expected but that seems common in the world of software development.  Having support for very large files, i.e., file size up to 4 GB, in version 2 is important to me and that is the reason for the delay.  The number one reported problem with version 1 is "out of memory" errors which is caused by working with large files.  My goal is to eliminate this error with version 2. 

There is still no time framework for the release of version 2.  I want to say the first beta release will be ready soon but I have been saying that for a long time. 

For those considering purchasing vesion 1 today but worried about being charged for upgrading to version 2, you do not need to worry.  Version 2 will be a free update for all licensed version 1 users.  This is my way of saying thank you to the customers who have supported Killink CSV Editor during its initial release.
