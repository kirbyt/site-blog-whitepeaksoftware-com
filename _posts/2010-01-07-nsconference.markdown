Earlier today I mentioned being selected as a speaker at [360iDev San Jose](http://www.360idev.com/) in April. But before I fly out to San Jose, I fly down to Atlanta for [NSConference](http://nsconference.com/). I'm looking forward to attending this event. For those wondering about NSConference, check out this promo video.
