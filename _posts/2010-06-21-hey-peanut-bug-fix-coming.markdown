I discovered a bug in Hey Peanut running under iOS 4, which Apple released to the public today. The bug has been fixed. I had hoped to get an update to the App Store before today but I've been waiting for the new artwork for iPhone 4. I will be submitting the update to Apple as soon as possible. The bug, for those curious, causes Hey Peanut to crash when you touch the camera icon to add new photos.
