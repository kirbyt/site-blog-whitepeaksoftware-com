title: "Labor Mate 1.3 Rejected Due to Crash"

I received an email from Apple today saying that the recent submission of Labor Mate 1.3 has been rejected due to a crash. The crash apparently is happening during the launch. Now of course I went through extensive testing with the app prior to submitting it and my debug and release builds never crashed. That was until today. 

This morning I installed the iPhone OS 3.0 SDK and tried running Labor Mate in the simulator.  I didn't recompile it.  It was already installed from previous sessions. So guess what. It crashes on launch. How strange is that?  Coincidence? Me doesn't think so.

Update: Definitely a coincidence. There is one particular scenarion that I failed to test, and sure enough the app is crashing in that scenarion. Apple's review process saved me from an embarrassing moment.
