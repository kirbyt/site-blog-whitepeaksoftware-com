I decided to give the Wordpress plug-in [WP to Twitter](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-to-twitter/) a try. My hope is I'm able to write blog posts from my Mac using [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) and have a link to the post auto-magically posted to [my Twitter account](http://twitter.com/kirbyt). This is my first test using this setup. Assuming it works, it will be my first and only test. Here goes.
