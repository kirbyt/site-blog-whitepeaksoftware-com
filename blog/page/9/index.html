    <div class="entry-content"><p>At long last Labor Mate 1.2 is in the App Store.  Only 6 weeks later then I originally hoped, but better late then never. Why did it take so long? Good question.</p>

<p>The version 1.2 release of Labor Mate took longer then expected because it is basically a re-write from the original. I probably should have labeled it version 2.0 but I decided against it because there are only a handful of new features.  The re-write was needed to give the app greater stability especially in low memory conditions.  The re-write will also make it easier for me to add new features going forward.</p>

<p>So what new features are included? Well, my favorite is the new contraction detail screen that allows users to enter notes about the contraction or delete the contraction from the log.  Adding notes will be handy for when you need to remember something about the particular contraction.  And yes, the notes are included in the email that is sent from Labor Mate.</p>

<p><img alt='' src='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/main/static/images/labor-mate/laborMate.png' />Some users might notice the new app icon.  Jeff and Michael over at <a href='http://ocupop.com/'>Ocupop</a> did an outstanding job coming up with the new icon, which really captures the primary purpose of Labor Mate.  I highly recommend these guys if you are looking for a design company.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s next? I already have ideas for the next release of Labor Mate. The top priority is charting, or a graph representing a set of contractions over time. I have a couple of other ideas too but I&#8217;m keeping those to myself at the moment. I want to make sure they are doable before making any promises.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>The next release of Labor Mate, the labor contraction stopwatch for the iPhone and iPod touch, is nearly complete. The new release will include a new icon, some changes to the user interface, and some new functionality including being able to delete an individual contraction and adding notes to a contraction. But more importantly are the number of improvements behind the scenes.</p>

<p>A number of memory leaks have been fixed, and areas such as scrolling have been improved. It&#8217;s fair to say that this release of Labor Mate is almost a complete re-write of the original. This is a good thing because it will enable me to add new features faster in the future.</p>

<p>To those of you whom I told the next release would be available two weeks ago, sorry for the delay and thanks for your patience.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>Work on the new major release for Killink CSV Editor continues.  It is taking me much longer than expected but that seems common in the world of software development.  Having support for very large files, i.e., file size up to 4 GB, in version 2 is important to me and that is the reason for the delay.  The number one reported problem with version 1 is &#8220;out of memory&#8221; errors which is caused by working with large files.  My goal is to eliminate this error with version 2.</p>

<p>There is still no time framework for the release of version 2.  I want to say the first beta release will be ready soon but I have been saying that for a long time.</p>

<p>For those considering purchasing vesion 1 today but worried about being charged for upgrading to version 2, you do not need to worry.  Version 2 will be a free update for all licensed version 1 users.  This is my way of saying thank you to the customers who have supported Killink CSV Editor during its initial release.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>Great news!  As of this morning, December 25, McAfee has resolved the mis-identification issue affecting Killink CSV Editor.  Customers effected by this problem should update McAfee with the latest virus protection update then re-install Killink CSV Editor.</p>

<p>The re-install of Killink CSV Editor is necessary since McAfee forcibly removed the program file killinkcsv.exe.  Optionally, you may be able to restore the program through the McAfee Security Center but I cannot guarantee this will work since individual configurations of McAfee may be different.</p>

<p>You can download the latest version of Killink CSV Editor from <a href='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv-download.aspx'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Sorry for any inconvenience this problem may have caused.  Hopefully it will not happen again.</p></div>

<p>I have filled a report with McAfee alerting them of the issue.  Unfortunately there is no good workaround to the problem short of not using McAfee, but I do <strong>not</strong> recommend turning off virus protection for Windows users.  I will provide updates as I get them from McAfee.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>I am slowly but surely making progress on version 2 of Killink CSV Editor. I&#8217;m focusing most of my attention right now on huge (aka, very large) file support.  You know, files greater than 1GB.  My goal is to support up to 4GB file sizes under the 32-bit version of Windows XP and Vista.  However, a major challenge is how to handle sorting.  Image opening a very large file, say 3GB, highlighting columns B, D, and G, and sorting on all three columns.  With what will most likely be millions and millions of rows in the file, sorting is going to be a little slow, so I need to really ramp up the sort algorithm to ensure descent performance.  And I need to make sure memory usage is low at the same time.  Definitely fun challenges to tackle with version 2.</p></div>

I forgot to post version 1.13 of Killink CSV Editor.  I&#8217;ve been working on version 2 and between that and other things my mind has been elsewhere.  Still no excuse for not getting this version out sooner especially considering that it contains the bug fix for the find and replace feature.  I sincerely apologize to the Killink CSV users out there for this delay.</p>

<p>With that said, I&#8217;m happy to announce the immediated availability for version 1.13 of the Killink CSV Editor. This update is free to all licensed users and contains the following updates:</p>

<p>* Fixes the find and replace <a href='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/forums/Topic275-12-1.aspx'>bug</a>.</p>

<p>* Adds the shortcut key Ctrl+Home to move to the top left most cell.</p>

<p>* Adds the shortcut key Ctrl+End to the move the bottom right most cell.</p>
