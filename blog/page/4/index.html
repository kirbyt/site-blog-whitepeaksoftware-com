I had hoped to get an update to the App Store before today but I&#8217;ve been waiting for the new artwork for iPhone 4. I will be submitting the update to Apple as soon as possible. The bug, for those curious, causes Hey Peanut to crash when you touch the camera icon to add new photos.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>In April I blogged about an <a href='http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/04/26/i-paid-for-microsofts-mistake/'>issue I was having with Microsoft</a> regarding a questionable past due invoice. I&#8217;m happy to report that the issue has finally been resolved. Microsoft owned up to the mistake and will be issuing a refund for full amount paid to the collection agency.</p>

<p>Long story short, the payment I made in December 2004 was applied to the December 2005 invoice. This basically resulted in me getting the first year of service for free, though I didn&#8217;t know it. And I never received the December 2005 invoice because it had been paid with the money charged in December 2004. Also, when the billing system was moved from Placeware to Microsoft, a mistake was made to my account which caused the December 2006 invoice not to be sent to me. Because I never received invoices for December 2005 and December 2006, it&#8217;s logical to see how I thought the account was canceled after the first year of service, which started in December 2004.</p>

<p>Thanks to the blog post in April, Microsoft did in fact contact me regarding the issue. If not for the attention received by the posting, I would have remained bitter towards Microsoft. Instead, an extremely helpful Julie McNamara-Dahl from Microsoft went above and beyond to get to the bottom of the issue. Julie&#8217;s efforts have single handedly restored my trust in Microsoft&#8217;s customer service. And best of all, with the help of others at Microsoft, she was able to get to the bottom of the matter and answer my question, &#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>I hate that the matter blew up like this, and I hate that it was something haunting me for years. But in the end, the whole affair proved to me that Microsoft does listen and does strive to provide excellent customer service.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say a big thank you to Julie and those who helped her. THANK YOU! This matter is definitely closed.</p></div>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/06/10/using-uipopovercontroller-with-ios-4/">Using UIPopoverController with iOS 4</a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran into an interesting bug today while testing Hey Peanut on iOS 4. For those who don&#8217;t know, Hey Peanut is a universal binary, which means it runs on both the iPhone and iPad. My iPhone has the GM version of iOS 4 installed on it, which I&#8217;m using to test my apps under iOS 4.</p>

<p>Because Hey Peanut can run on both the iPhone and iPad, my code must include certain checks to avoid crashes. One check the code makes is to determine if the class UIPopoverController is available or not. Prior to iOS 4, this class was only available in iOS 3.2. The current release of iOS on the iPhone is version 3.1.3, and it does not include this class. To make use of the popover I use code such as the following:</p>

<pre><code>   Class popoverControllerClass = NSClassFromString(@&quot;UIPopoverController&quot;);

   if (popoverControllerClass) {

      popoverController_ = [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:[self imagePicker]];

   }</code></pre>

<p>Turns out there is a big problem with this code under iOS 4 causing Hey Peanut to crash each time. It wasn&#8217;t obvious to me at first why this code was failing but as I thought it more, and as I talked through the issue with an Apple engineer, I realized, &#8220;Duh! iOS 4 is running on the iPhone, not the iPad.&#8221; Simply checking for the existence of the class isn&#8217;t good enough any more. Instead, I need to also check the device type. So with a quick change to the code, shown below, I was able to fix the crash in Hey Peanut. The code now checks that the class is available and is running on a iPad.</p>

<pre><code>   Class popoverControllerClass = NSClassFromString(@&quot;UIPopoverController&quot;);

   if (popoverControllerClass **&amp;&amp; UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad**) {

      popoverController_ = [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:[self imagePicker]];

   }</code></pre></div>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/06/01/sales-are-down-but-revenue-is-up/">Sales are Down but Revenue is Up</a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago I was having some post-CocoaHeads beers with <a href='http://outerlevel.com/'>Jon Trainer</a> and <a href='http://www.red-sweater.com/'>Daniel Jalkut</a>. We were talking about the success I&#8217;ve had with Labor Mate. They both insisted I raise the price from $0.99 to something higher. Both had sound reasons why a price increase would work for Labor Mate. For instance, the price range for competing apps range is from free to $9.99. A higher price point will help Labor Mate stand out. Everything Jon and Daniel said made sense, but I was skeptical.</p>

<p>For those who don&#8217;t know, Labor Mate is a niche app for the iPhone. It has been in the Top 100 in the Health and Fitness category for multiple App Stores including the U.S. for more than a year. Back in November Labor Mate&#8217;s status in the Health and Fitness category started to drop due to two competitors being mentioned in the What&#8217;s Hot lists. Despite the drop in rankings Labor Mate continues to sale well, slowly and steadily earning more money per month. A big part of this success comes from international sales, which have steadily improved since translating Labor Mate into 8 other languages. Another part of the success comes from the fact that the app is rock solid. It doesn&#8217;t crash, and as one of the reviewers recently said about Labor Mate, &#8220;Maybe not the slickest looking app for counting contractions, but we didn&#8217;t want to risk crashing or accidentally losing data - we just wanted a reliable app that would work under pressure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even though I was not confident of a positive outcome, I decided to follow the advice from Jon and Daniel. I raised the price of Labor Mate from $0.99 to $1.99. My plan was to leave it at the higher price for a minimum of one week. As expected the first full day at the new price saw spike in revenue. However, sales dropped. This trend continued for the first week. As a result, Labor Mate lost most of its visibility in the App Store&#8217;s Top 100 for Health and Fitness. I figured it was only a matter of time before sales and revenue hit an all time low.</p>

<p>Despite what appeared to be a downward trend, I decided to continue the pricing experiment for a second week. To my surprise sales started to return to its normal pattern, a spiky, Bart Simpson-like hair cut. What I noticed was exactly what Jon and Daniel said would happen. I started making more money. Jon and Daniel were right! Sure, daily unit sales were lower than before the price increase, but revenue was higher for those two weeks. So while Labor Mate dropped from the rankings of the Top 100 in the Health and Fitness category and the number of units sold per day dropped, in the end I made more money.</p>

<p>The next big question now is, will Labor Mate revenue continue its slow but steady climb at this higher price point, or will the overall trend start heading downwards? I&#8217;ve decided to keep Labor Mate at the $1.99 price for another week to see what happens.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for those of you who prefer looking at charts, I&#8217;ve included the sales and revenue charts for Labor Mate covering the time period between April 1, 2010, and May 31, 2010. There was a spike in mid-April but sales started dropping afterwards. The red-dash line is the first full day at the new, higher price. The spike on that day was almost as high as the spike in April.</p>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/05/28/some-really-useful-xcode-plugins/">Some Really Useful Xcode Plugins</a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>Xcode is a suite of developer tools for Mac and iPhone programming. Xcode is also the IDE included in the developer tools. As far as IDEs go, Xcode has become my favorite over the years. It&#8217;s simple yet powerful. But as good as it is, there&#8217;s always room for improvement, so yesterday I <a href='http://twitter.com/kirbyt/status/14852962957'>asked on Twitter</a>, what plugins do other Xcode developers find useful? Turns out there are a number of really useful Xcode plugins. Here is the list of favorites based on responses to my tweet.</p>

<p><a href='http://macoscope.net/en/mac/codepilot/'>Code Pilot</a> is by far the favorite based on the number of responses I received. Code Pilot provides easy navigation through your Xcode project. If you are a keyboard junkie like me than you owe it to yourself to try out Code Pilot.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html'>Accessorizer</a> is the second most popular plugin. Accessorizer saves you time by generating boiler plate code for you. For instance, you can use Accessorizer to generate the @property declarations based on a set of ivars. Give the <a href='http://www.kevincallahan.org/AccessorizerDocuments/Accessorizer-QuickStartGuide.pdf'>Accessorizer Quick Start Guide</a> (PDF) a read to get a sense of what Accessorizer can do for you.</p>

<p><a href='http://rentzsch.github.com/mogenerator/'>Mogenerator</a> tied for second most popular plugin. It generates Objective-C code for Core Data models. It works differently than Xcode in that Mogenerator manages two classes per entity, one intended for the machine and the other intended for humans. The Mogenerator sites says, &#8220;The machine class can always be overwritten to match the data model, with humans’ work effortlessly preserved.&#8221; Perfect for Core Data projects. FYI, Mogenerator is an open source project created and maintained by the most-excellent <a href='http://rentzsch.com/'>Jonathan &#8216;Wolf&#8217; Rentzsch</a>.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.obdev.at/products/completion-dictionary/index.html'>Completion Dictionary</a> is a free plugin that enhances Xcode&#8217;s own code completion. It allows you to define your own expansion macros. You type a few letters and press the completion shortcut. You instantly have new code added to the file. This plugin reminds me of Delphi Live Templates, which I used religiously back when I did lots of Delphi programming. Oh, and did I mention Completion Dictionary is free?</p>

<p>What other Xcode plugins are out there? Which ones do you find useful? Post a comment if you have a favorite plugin not listed here.</p></div>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/05/28/its-official-im-nuts/">It's Official. I'm Nuts.</a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>Turns out I&#8217;m nuts, and I can prove it. Last week a signed a contract to publish a book with Addison Wesley. Justin Williams at <a href='http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/'>SecondGear</a> put it best when he asked, &#8220;ARE YOU NUTS!?&#8221; Yep, apparently I am. And signing the book contract is my proof.</p>

<p>Kidding aside, I&#8217;m very excited about this opportunity to contribute back to iPhone development community, a community that has been extremely helpful to me over the last couple of years. The book is on learning iPad programming. It will focus on the unique aspects of programming for the iPad and will hopefully serve as a launch pad for many new iPad programmer entering the space.</p>

<p>Writing on the book has just begun, and I have a very aggressive 6-month delivery schedule. My life is going to be busier than ever over the next 6 months, but it will be a good busy as this is something I have wanted to do for a long time. So if you don&#8217;t hear from me much between now and November, you know why.</p></div>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/05/20/learning-while-watching-myself/">Learning While Watching Myself</a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href='http://www.360conferences.com/conference-videos#360idevsanjose2010'>video recording of my 360idev</a> talk &#8220;Building Web Service Powered iPhone Apps&#8221; is now available from 360idev (free to attendees, for purchase for non-attendees). This was the first time a presentation I gave was recorded, and for the first time ever I get to see my own talk. I watched the video yesterday and overall I&#8217;m happy with the results. The best part for me, however, is using the video to learn from my mistakes.</p>

<p>A mistake I repeatedly made was not repeating questions asked by the audience. Repeating the question is an age old speaker tip, but the tip is easily forgotten during an actual presentation. Repeating the question is helpful to others in the audience who may not have heard the original question. Repeating the question also gives you a chance to make sure you understand the question, and it buys you a few more seconds while you think of an answer.</p>

<p>Repeating the question becomes more important when your session is being recorded. In the case of the 360idev recording of my session, you cannot hear questions from the audience. This sometimes makes it hard to understand the context of the answer. I could have avoided this by repeating each question before providing an answer. The lesson learned here, and one I must remember the each time I speak, is to repeat the question before answering.</p>

<p>The other lesson I learned by watching my session is to not do live coding. Live coding can be impressive, earning you some respect points with audience members. But live coding can also slow down the presentation. This is what happened in my session. There are lulls during my talk while I type code from memory. Also audience members will often see mistakes in your code as you type and shout out tips. This can break your thought process causing confusion and delay.</p>

<p>Having now watched my session video I have decided to no longer do live coding in these types of sessions. The extra time spent typing on the keyboard is better spent sharing additional knowledge with the audience.</p></div>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/05/18/follow-up-on-my-fight-with-microsoft/">Follow up on My Fight with Microsoft</a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago I posted a story of how <a href='http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/04/26/i-paid-for-microsofts-mistake/'>Microsoft turned me over to a collection agency</a> for a past due invoice that 1) I never originally received, 2) for an account canceled a year before the said invoice was issued, and 3) no one from Microsoft is willing to talk with me about to answer my questions. As a final straw and an attempt to put the matter behind me, I paid the invoice even though I still feel the invoice is the result of an accounting error made by Microsoft.</p>

<p>The blog post got the attention of a large number of people. People were tweeting about my story and some popular web sites picked up the story. The increased traffic to my web site brought down my server for 4 hours and I scrambled to get the site up and running again as quickly as possible. But more importantly the blog post caught the attention of some Microsoft employees.</p>

<p>Two employees contacted me regarding the matter and offered to help. This was great news. I had hopes that I would finally have my questions answered. After all, that&#8217;s all I really want at this time, is to have my questions answered.</p>

<p>One of the Microsoft employees made some progress in finding a person to help figure out the mess. It looked like I would finally have some answered. Then the collection agency called again. Yep, instead of Microsoft following up with me directly they asked the collection agency to call me.</p>

<p>The agent I spoke with was the same person I spoke with last month. He said Microsoft ask him to call me to see what can be done to &#8220;smooth things over&#8221;. I told the agent the same thing I told him last month. All I want is to talk with someone from Microsoft who can explain to me what happened. All I want is answered to my questions.</p>

<p>It is not about the money. Paying Microsoft $134 is not going to bankrupt White Peak Software. But what I really want is to speak with someone who can answer my questions regarding the matter. It&#8217;s doubtful that will ever happen since Microsoft seems to prefer hiding behind contractors and collection agencies with limited information then to talk with me directly.</p>

<p>The fact that Microsoft will not talk with me directly makes me trust Microsoft less. Because I do not like doing business with companies I do not trust, it is likely the $134 I paid last month will be the last dollar Microsoft ever receives from me. The ironic part in all of this mess is Microsoft could have saved my trust in them as a consumer with a simple phone call.</p>

<p>At the end of the day it is about providing great customer service and this is something that Microsoft has failed to do.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>Tags: 360idev, Last month I had the fortunate opportunity to talk at <a href='http://www.360idev.com/'>360idev</a>. My talk was on using web services in iPhone apps. The talk got off to a bad start due to various technical issues, the biggest issue caused when my MacBook Pro and the projector would not talk with one another. This caused my talk to start late which meant I had to skip some of the details I wanted to cover.</p>

<p>Another issue came up with I tried to demo a RESTful web service call to Twitter using <a href='http://ditchnet.org/httpclient/'>HTTP Client</a>. Twitter reported the request limit had been reached for the IP address. This meant I had to skip over the Twitter related demos. Lucky for me, the rest of the presentation and demos ran smoothly.</p>

<p>For those who may have missed the presentation, the fine folks at 360idev have posted a <a href='http://www.360conferences.com/conference-videos#360idevsanjose2010'>video recording of the session</a> available for purchase. You can also download the sample source code and the Keynote presentation file from my <a href='http://github.com/kirbyt/360idev'>360idev repository</a> hosted on github.</p></div>
