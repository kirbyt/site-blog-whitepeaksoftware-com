<div class="entry-content"><p>Life has been crazy busy recently. Of course it seems my life is always crazy busy, and just when I think it can&#8217;t get any more crazy busy, it does. I&#8217;m behind on a number of things, and I can&#8217;t help but feel overwhelmed. Heck, feeling overwhelmed is probably an understatement for how I feel right now.</p>

<p>This year has been an amazing year for me, work-wise. I reinvented White Peak Software last year as company focused on iOS, and this year is shaping up to be my most exciting and enjoyable year in the company&#8217;s (almost) 7 year history. But a number of things are suffering as well. Progress on the book is suffering. Product updates are suffering. New product releases are suffering. Even client work is suffering because there&#8217;s simply no way for me to keep up with the demands. Despite of all this, I feel a bit better this evening after reading a posting from Jeff LaMarche.</p>

<p>I look up to Jeff, and I&#8217;m amazed at how much work he pumps out. I often wonder where he finds the time - not having a two year old in the house probably helps - and I&#8217;m convinced he never sleeps. In his posting <a href='http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/09/complaining-about-success.html'>Complaining About Success</a>, Jeff mentions &#8220;time has become a scarce commodity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah, he is human. He does fall behind from time to time.</p>

<p>While I feel for Jeff, I admit reading his post makes me feel a bit relieved that I&#8217;m not alone.</p>

<p>And Jeff, if you are reading this, I plan to stick with the <a href='http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/09/dealloc.html'>release then nil</a> approach. It&#8217;s the approach I learned when first diving into Objective-C. Old habits are sometimes hard to break.</p></div>

<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/09/11/customizing-the-look-of-uinavigationbar-and-uinavigationcontroller.html">Customizing the Look of UINavigationBar and UINavigationController</a></h1>
<div class="entry-content"><img align='left' src='http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CustomNavBar.png' />
<p>I&#8217;ve recently worked on a number of iOS projects that require a custom background for the UINavigationBar including the navigation bar used by the UINavigationController. Customizing the look of a UINavigationBar is actually pretty simple. You can set the tintColor property to the color of your choice. But sometimes you need to do more. For example, say you want to have a title in your navigation bar that uses a font not available on iPad and iPhone. For this you will need to use an image to customize the navigation bar.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the various ways to customize the navigation bar.</p>

<p>The UINavigationBar has a style property called barStyle. barStyle can be set to UIBarStyleDefault or UIBarStyleBlack. The default uses a blue gradient background. When using UIBarStyleBlack you can also set the translucent property to YES to give the navigation bar a partially opaque look. If you are using Interface Builder, then you will set the Style property in the Inspector window. Here you have the option to style the navigation bar as Default, Black Opaque, and Black Translucent.</p>

<p>What if you want a color other than blue and black? You can set the tintColor property (aka Tint in IB) to any color you like. This changes the navigation bar&#8217;s color. Best of all, setting the tintColor will also change the background color used by the bar button items displayed within the navigation bar.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, just changing the tint of the UINavigationBar isn&#8217;t enough. Sometimes you want to have a fancier background. Maybe the background you want has a different gradient style or lighting effect, or maybe you want a title displayed in the center of the navigation bar to use a font not available in iOS. How would you change the look of the navigation bar for these scenarios? Simple. You use an image that is drawn on the navigation bar.</p>

<p>There are two approaches you can use to draw an image on the navigation bar. You can create a new class that inherits from UINavigationBar and override the drawRect method. For example:</p>

<pre><code>@interface KTNavigationBar : UINavigationBar {

}
@end

@implementation KTNavigationBar

- (void) drawRect:(CGRect)rect
{
    [super drawRect:rect];

    UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed: @&amp;amp;amp;quot;navbar.png&amp;amp;amp;quot;];
    [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height)];
}

@end</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the image navbar.png is used to customize, or skin, the UINavigationBar. This is a nice, clean, object orientated way to customize the look of your navigation bar. The only thing you must remember to do is to use your custom UINavigationBar class within your application. This means changing the class type for those of us using IB.</p>

<p>Another trick you can use that doesn&#8217;t require changing the class type is to use a category. For example:</p>

<pre><code>@interface UINavigationBar (KTCustomLook)

- (void) drawRect:(CGRect)rect;

@end

@implementation UINavigationBar (KTCustomLook)

- (void) drawRect:(CGRect)rect
{

    UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed: @&amp;amp;amp;quot;navbar.png&amp;amp;amp;quot;];
    [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height)];
}

@end</code></pre>

<p>I admit I have used this approach in more than one project, but doesn&#8217;t feel right to me. It feels more like using voodoo or black magic then following good OO design. But this approach does work and it does save you time by eliminating the need to change the class type for each instance of UINavigationBar within your app. [Update: This approach doesn&#8217;t feel right because it overrides a method in a category. You should know this is a bad, bad thing, and I don&#8217;t encourage others to do it. That said, it does work.]</p>

<p>One thing to note when using an image to customize the UINavigationBar, you still want to set the tintColor for the navigation bar. As I mentioned, setting this property will also change the background color used by the bar button items. So you want to set the tintColor to the appropriate color making the button color fit in with the navigation bar color style.</p>

<p>For those of you who want to see these concepts in action, I posted a <a href='http://github.com/kirbyt/CustomNavBar'>sample project, called CustomNavBar</a>, on github. Enjoy.</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Fall is almost here and it&#8217;s going to be a busy on for me. Not only will I be heads down trying to finish my upcoming book, I will be speaking at two iOS developer conferences. The first conference is <a href='http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/iphonefall2010/'>Voices That Matter</a> in Philadelphia on October 16 and 17. This will be my first VTM, and I&#8217;m very excited to be apart of the event. There are a lot of great talks planned for the 2-day conference. My talk will be on the advantages of writing universal apps for iPad and iPhone. Early bird pricing ends today so register now to save money. Use the discount code PHASPKR to save even more money.</p>

<p>The second conference I&#8217;m speaking at this fall is <a href='http://www.360idev.com/'>360iDev Austin</a>. It&#8217;s no secret that 360iDev is one of my favorite developer conferences. I have made numerous friends since attending my first 360iDev last year, and the networking I&#8217;ve done at past 360iDev conferences has help land me paying gigs. My session at 360iDev will be on the fundamentals of iPad programming. This session is intended for anyone just starting out with iPad programming. Earlier bird pricing as already ended for 360iDev Austin but even at the full price of $599, it is money well spent if you are serious about iOS programming.</p></div>

<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/09/01/my-app-store-pricing-experiment-the-final-chapter.html">My App Store Pricing Experiment: The Final Chapter</a></h1>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Today is my final update on the pricing experiment I started back in May. You can read the previous posts <a href='http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/06/01/sales-are-down-but-revenue-is-up/'>here</a> and <a href='http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/07/02/sale-numbers-are-in-an-update-on-my-app-store-pricing-experiment/'>here</a>. The goal of the experiment was to see if the sales trend for Labor Mate would continue at the higher price of $1.99. After three full months, I can say the higher price has done more harm than good.</p>

<p>Labor Mate continues to bring in over $1K per month despite the higher price, but the trend doesn&#8217;t look good. Over the last few weeks, the number of sales has decreased everywhere except in Japan. For some reason, sales are up in Japan and if not for Japanese sales in August, Labor Mate would have posted it&#8217;s worse sales month in 6 months.</p>

<p>Since it&#8217;s inception date, revenue for Labor Mate has been on a slow but steady rise. The higher price has reversed that trend. Labor Mate now appears to be on a slow but steady fall. Not only that, Labor Mate, which at one time was in the Health and Fitness Top 100 category in App Stores throughout the world, is not longer visible on any Top 100 chart, anywhere. This three month pricing experiment maybe the start of a slow death for Labor Mate, but it&#8217;s not done for yet.</p>

<p>I have big plans in the works, and a new update is just around the corner. I was planning a big release in a few weeks that would hopefully justify the $1.99 price tag in the eyes of consumers but I&#8217;m changing my strategy. Starting today, Labor Mate is back down to 99 cents, and instead of a big update in a few weeks, I&#8217;m going to release 3 or 4 updates over the next 1 to 2 months. My goal here is to get Labor Mate back on track and return to the trend I was seeing before the price increase.</p>

<p>Update: One thing I should point out is Labor Mate has a lot of competition. The other similar apps cost between free and 99 cents. This maybe a key reason why a $1.99 Labor Mate cannot sustain the slow but steady growth seen by the 99 cent Labor Mate.</p></div>

<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/08/29/ipad-stylus-review.html">iPad Stylus Review</a></h1>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I admit I don&#8217;t have a strong need for a stylus when using my iPad, but there have been occasions when I wish I had one. Using my finger to take notes in a drawing app is sometimes frustrating to me. My finger drawn text is usually too large, and on hot summer days, my finger doesn&#8217;t always glide smoothly over the surface of my iPad. So I decided to give an stylus a try. The problem was, which stylus to buy.</p>

<p>I narrowed my search down to two styluses, the <a href='http://www.tenonedesign.com/sketch.php'>Pogo Sketch</a> from Ten One Design and the <a href='http://www.boxwave.com/products/capacitivestylus/apple-ipad-capacitive-stylus_3779.htm'>Boxwave Capacitive iPad Stylus</a>. I spent more time than I should have reading reviews of both only to come to the conclusion: I don&#8217;t know which one to buy. So I bought both.</p>

<p>The Pogo Sketch gets points for price ($10.78 on Amazon at the time), which is much less than the Boxwave ($20.95 plus $4 shipping). Both work well on my iPad. The Pogo Sketch is longer and thinner, and felt cheaper than the Boxwave. The Boxwave stylus is heavier and thicker, much like a nice ball point pen, but it is short. I personally don&#8217;t mind the shortness since I&#8217;ve carried short pens in my pocket for most of my life, but others might not care for it.</p>

<p>The tip on the Pogo is shaped differently than on the Boxwave. With the Pogo tip, I can hold the stylus in different positions as I draw, sort of like a pencil. The Boxwave, on the other hand, is like using a pen. I find myself holding it in the same position as I would a pen.</p>

<p>The Pogo tip also looks like it could wear out quickly. With both styluses I must use more pressure to draw than I would with pencil and paper. I can&#8217;t help but feel I will flatten out the Pogo tip quickly with regular use. On the other hand, the Boxwave tip looks and feels solid, and I don&#8217;t have the same concern of it wearing out.</p>

<p>After spending time with both, I decided I prefer the Boxwave Capacitive iPad Stylus over the Pogo Sketch. I like the thickness and weight of the Boxwave, and it doesn&#8217;t have that cheap feel that the Pogo does. But $25 is a lot to spend. Given the amount of time I will use a stylus and having played with both, I know I would have been happy with the Pogo Sketch. But since I bought both, I will continue using the Boxwave stylus, and I will likely give away the Pogo Sketch at an <a href='http://nshappyhour.org/'>NSHappyHour</a> or similar event.</p>

<p>Speaking of NSHappyHour, I brought both styluses with me to the July NSHappyHour for others to try out. Jon Lee was kind enough to email me his own review, which I&#8217;ve included here. I love his final verdict.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Finger:</em></p>

<p>Pros: Always available when you need it. If you lose one, there is always another.</p>

<p>Cons: Pen tip is too squishy, and big. Writing by finger is an awkward user experience.</p>

<p><em>Pogo Sktech</em></p>

<p>Pros: Tip feels smaller, like you&#8217;re drawing with a thin Crayola marker. Using a stylus is familiar as a experience, as compared to finger painting.</p>

<p>Cons: The squishy sponge material makes me afraid that if I press too hard I will scratch the iPad surface with the edge of the ring that holds the sponge. Sponge feels very rippable after continued use.</p>

<p><em>Boxwave Capacitive iPad Stylus</em></p>

<p>Pros: Good weight, feels substantial. The tip, being rubber, feels like it could last longer than the Pogo.</p>

<p>Cons: The rubber end is like the bulb end of a turkey baster. And it feels like you&#8217;re writing with one. The thicker footprint does not make me feel like I have a high chance of being accurate when I draw. And $20? Really?</p>

<p>Verdict:</p>

<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/08/23/dont-rely-on-uidevice-orientation-for-rotation.html">Don't Rely on UIDevice orientation for Rotation</a></h1>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I tweeted about having rotation issues with an iPad app I&#8217;m working on. This is the second time in recent weeks I&#8217;ve encountered rotation issues in an app. In both instances I was using a <code>UIScrollView</code> so I started thinking the <code>UIScrollView</code> was source of my problems. In the most recent instance the <code>UIScrollView</code> contains a <code>UIView</code> that uses a number of <code>CALayer</code> instances for content display.</p>

<p>For those who don&#8217;t know, in Mac OS X 10.5 and greater, <code>CALayer</code> has the <code>autoresizingMask</code> property. Unfortunately this property does not exists under iOS, so it&#8217;s up to my code to do the resizing CALayers as needed. This is where the rotation issue revealed itself.</p>

<p>As the device is rotated from portrait to landscape, or vice versa, my view must resize and adjust the layout of the CALayers. Because <code>UIView</code> does not receive the rotation notifications I decided to be smart and use the <a href='http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIDevice_Class/Reference/UIDevice.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006902-CH3-SW3'>orientation property</a> from <code>UIDevice</code>. So in my view I had code similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>UIInterfaceOrientation interfaceOrientation = [[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation];

if (UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscape(interfaceOrientation) == YES) {

    // Adjust for landscape.

} else {

    // Adjust for portrait.

}</code></pre>

<p>What I failed to realize, however, is that the property <code>orientation</code> will <strong>always</strong> return 0 unless orientation notifications are enabled. Here is a quote directly from the Developer Documentation:</p>

<p>&#8220;The value of this property always returns 0 unless orientation notifications have been enabled by calling beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doh! Guess I should have RTFM sooner.</p>

<p>Because the <code>orientation</code> property will return 0, sometimes the view in my app would not rotate. But I didn&#8217;t know this was the source of the problem at the time.</p>

<p>After banging my head over and over on the wall, I decided to investigate exactly what was happening. I never suspected <code>[[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation]</code> but eventually I noticed it was returning 0. This seemed odd so I checked the Developer Documentation. I wasn&#8217;t expecting to learn anything new. Boy, was I wrong. I was surprised when I read the property always returns 0 when orientation notifications are not enabled.</p>

<p>I now knew the source of my rotation problems, and a likely quick fix to the problem would have been to call <code>beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications</code>, get the device orientation, then call <code>endGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications</code>. But this just seemed wrong to me. The better fix, in my opinion, is to rely on the rotation notifications received by the view controller, so that&#8217;s exactly what I did.</p>

<p>Now in my particular situation, there are two times I want to resize and layout the CALayers in the <code>UIView</code>. One of those times is when the device is rotated, which is when the view controller receives the <code>willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:</code> message. This was easy to solve. I added an <code>adjustLayoutToInterfaceOrientation:</code> method to my <code>UIView</code> and I call the method inside the UIViewController&#8217;s <code>willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:</code> method. For example:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration 

{
    [view_ adjustLayoutToInterfaceOrientation:toInterfaceOrientation];
}</code></pre>

<p>The other time my <em>UIView</em> needs to adjust the layout of the CALayers is when the <em>UIScrollView</em> scrolls. I&#8217;m using a modified version of Matt Gallagher&#8217;s <a href='http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/01/multiple-virtual-pages-in-uiscrollview.html'>virtual pages in a UIScrollView</a> approach, so the contents of my view changes as the user scrolls. This is where, previously, I was trying to be smart and use the <em>orientation</em> property from <em>UIDevice</em>. But what I really need is the current orientation as received in the most recent call to <code>willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:</code>.</p>

<p>My solution was to add the ivar currentOrientation to my view controller. My view already has a reference to the view controller. I exposed currentOrientation so my view can retrieve the property value. This allowed me to replace the <code>[[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation]</code> code with <code>[controller currentOrientation]</code>. Now the view always knows the current orientation and the app does not need to enable orientation notification in code.</p>

<p>As a result, the first code snippet in this posting changes to:</p>

<pre><code>UIInterfaceOrientation interfaceOrientation = [controller_ currentOrientation];

if (UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscape(interfaceOrientation) == YES) {

    // Adjust for landscape.

} else {

    // Adjust for portrait.

}</code></pre>

<p>And the <code>willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:</code> implementation changes to:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration 

{

    currentOrientation_ = toInterfaceOrientation;

    [view_ adjustLayoutToInterfaceOrientation:toInterfaceOrientation];

}</code></pre>

<p>This has been an eye opener for me, and I now have a new rule of thumb. Never use <code>UIDevice orientation</code> in code that is responsible for the resizing and layouts of subviews and CALayers.</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><p><img alt='HeyPeanut-1.3-preview2.png' src='http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/HeyPeanut-1.3-preview2.png' />At long last, a new theme is coming to Hey Peanut. Hey Peanut 1.3 was submitted to Apple today. This update includes a new safari theme for toddlers to enjoy. There is a hippo, giraffe, zebra, and a friendly lion. Also included in this update are all new animal sounds recorded from actual animal.</p>

<p>Previous releases of Hey Peanut used family-made sounds. What do I mean by &#8220;family-made&#8221; sounds? Well, the animal sounds were recordings of my wife and me attempting to mimic each of the farm animals. The sounds were silly but lacked a certain level of professionalism. Hey Peanut 1.3 will use all new sounds, and this time the animal sounds are the actual sounds from real animals, with one exception. A giraffe doesn&#8217;t really make a sound, so in Hey Peanut the giraffe sounds like a giggling kid. Of course, that kid giggling is my son, <a href='http://www.rowanturner.net/'>Rowan</a>, so there is still a family touch in this new release.</p>

<p>Hey Peanut 1.3 should be available for download from the App Store very soon. Meanwhile, keep an eye on the White Peak Software Twitter account, <a href='http://twitter.com/whitepeak'>@whitepeak</a>, for promo codes to redeem a free copy of Hey Peanut (U.S. App Store only).</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Life has been crazy busy over the last week but fun at the same time. I&#8217;m wrapping up a client project, and last week I spoke about iPad programming at the <a href='http://www.meetup.com/newyork-iphone-developers/'>NYC iPhone Developer Meet-up</a>. The next day I followed up the talk with a one-day training class on learning iPad programming. Thanks goes out to <a href='http://twitter.com/juliobarros'>Julio Barros</a> of <a href='http://www.e-string.com/'>E-String</a> for keeping me busy last week, I mean for giving me the opportunity to talk and teach.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting things that happened last week was being interviewed by a reporter from the largest news service in China. Here&#8217;s a <a href='http://yfrog.com/msa3yxj'>picture from the interview</a>, and yes, I look like a zombie in the picture. The reported asked some really good questions, and I think the interview went really well. But it&#8217;s doubtful I&#8217;ll ever see the interview since it will only air in China and the interview is unlikely to be available online. Still, it was fun to do.</p>

<p>A highlight from last week was seeing friends, old and new, Thursday night for drinks after the meet up. Made me realize how much I miss living in New York.</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I had the opportunity to teach a one-day class on learning iPad programming. One of the students asked what books I recommend. A friend asked the same question over the weekend, so I thought I might as well post the list of books on iOS and Objective-C programming I have found helpful.</p>
