    <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m making an early 2010 New Year&#8217;s Resolution. I&#8217;m going to blog more. There. I&#8217;ve said it. And in a blog posting no less. This entry will haunt me if I do not stick to this resolution.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve done a horrible job at blogging since my son was born 20 months ago. This is true for all 3 of my main blog site, my <a href='http://www.thecave.com/'>personal blog</a>, this <a href='http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/'>company/tech blog</a>, and even the <a href='http://RowanTurner.net'>blog about my son</a>. Of course it&#8217;s not his fault. I blame Twitter.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve developed a bad habit. If I can&#8217;t share it in 140 characters than I don&#8217;t share it. This is wrong on so many levels, especially since 2009 has been such an important year for White Peak Software, which I will explain in an upcoming blog.</p>

<p>So with that, you can expect more postings on this blog.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p><img alt='' src='/images/blog/2009-11-06-iPhoneJapanese1.png' /></p>

<p>I recently went through the process of translating Labor Mate into 8 different languages. Unfortunately the phrase &#8220;Labor Mate&#8221; doesn&#8217;t translate well into other languages such as Japanese and Germany so the translators came up with new localized app names. The problem I had though was displaying the translated app name on the iPhone&#8217;s springboard.</p>

<p>After a bit of experimenting I finally got the translated app name to display. Turns out the steps are fairly simple. Here are the steps I took to localize the app name:</p>

<p>1. Added the property LSHasLocalizedDisplayName to Info.plist and set to True (mark the checkbox). Note that Xcode might change the property name to &#8220;Application has localized display name&#8221;.</p>

<p>2. Add a new strings file called InfoPlist.strings.</p>

<p>3. Make the file InfoPlist.strings localizable.</p>

<p>4. Add the languages that will have a translated app name.</p>

<p>5. For each localized version of the InfoPlist.strings file, add the follow string key/value pair: CFBundleDisplayName = &#8220;App Name&#8221;;</p>

<p>6. Be sure to set &#8220;App Name&#8221; to the translated value.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>

<p><img alt='InfoPlist.strings' src='/images/blog/2009-11-06-InfoPlist.strings.png' /></p>

<p>Speaking of language translation, I hired the fine folks over at <a href='http://iphone-i18n.com/'>iphone-i18n.com</a> to translate the app description, keywords, and in-app strings for Labor Mate. I met Chuck and Judith of iphone-i18n.com at <a href='http://www.360idev.com/'>360iDev|Denver</a>. They impressed me with their knowledge of internationalizing and localizing applications as well as their specific technical how to knowledge for the iPhone.</p>

<p>If you are an iPhone developer looking to <a href='http://iphone-i18n.com/'>translate your iPhone application</a> into other languages then I highly recommend talking with Chuck and Judith at iphone-i18n.com.</p></div>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2009/10/13/360idev-denver-a-personal-review/">360idev Denver: A Personal Review</a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of weeks ago I attended <a href='http://www.360idev.com/'>360idev</a> in Denver. The conference was one of the best developer conferences I have ever attended and the best one I have attended in recent years. What made this conference so good? A number of things (in no particular order):</p>

<p>1) The people</p>

<p>2) The sessions</p>

<p>3) The Game Jam</p>

<p>4) The community (aka the people)</p>

<p>My conference experience started Saturday night when I met up with fellow iPhone developers from the Boston area. Prior to leaving for Denver I knew 1 other iPhone developer in the area, but by the time I left I had 6 new friends all building and publishing iPhone apps. Working from home for the last 5 years can get lonely so making new friends made the trip worth while even if the conference had suck, which it did not.</p>

<p>The conference kicked off on Sunday with a day of hands-on lab. This was actually Day 0 of the conference since these pre-conference sessions were held the day before the official conference start. I attended the advanced debugging and hacking the iPhone sessions. Both were amazing. I learned many new ticks in the debugging session, and I was blown away by <a href='http://www.saurik.com/'>Jay Freeman</a> who hacked the Maps app.</p>

<p>The bar by which all other conference sessions would be judged by me had been set on that day, and the bar was set high. Admittedly I expected the rest of the conference to not be nearly as good. Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>The next 3 days were packed with extremely helpful, useful, and insightful sessions. The sessions covered everything from business and marketing related topics to hands-on tech talks on topics such as Core Data, Core Animation, game development, and more. It&#8217;s hard to say what was my favorite session given that all the sessions I attended were outstanding sans 2 sessions. Those 2 sessions were still good, just not as good as the other sessions I attended.</p>

<p>A true highlight of the conference for me was the <a href='http://iphonegamejam.com/'>Game Jam</a>. The Game Jam was the brain child of <a href='http://gamesfromwithin.com/'>@SnappyTouch</a> and it was a total hit. The Game Jam was open to all, not just game developers. I&#8217;ve never done game development before but I&#8217;ve been interested in game development for quite some time now. So I attended. I joined forces with another Boston area developer. Our game ended up not being much, but that was fine. We had fun, and I totally enjoyed the experience. Just watching the other developers crank out some amazing work in the late hours of the night was a real thrill for me.</p>

<p>The number one lesson I got out of the Game Jam is to push myself beyond my comfort zone. I&#8217;ve been doing software development for more than half of my life and I&#8217;ve become comfortable with the type of apps I tend to write. The Game Jam reminded me of what it was like programming 20 years ago, back when I would write code just for the hell of it, when I would write tons of small programs just to learn something new or to trying something I thought was cool, and not worry if or how I could make money off the program. In some ways, you can say the Game Jam has re-kindled a lost spirit in me.</p>

<p>If I had to pick the one thing I liked the most about the conference I would have to say the sense of community. It has been a long time since I felt like a part of a community. This is due in part to me working from home for a number of years, but also in part to the difficulties finding a group of people who share a common interesting and passion. In ways it reminded me how I felt in the 90s attending BorCons and discovering the Delphi community. But this new iPhone developer community that I discovered at 360idev is different. Like me, almost everyone I met is an indie developer or is working for a small (2 to 5) person company. Also I was surprised, and a bit jealous, of the number of husband wife teams present at the conference.</p>

<p>As I said, 360idev Denver was the best developer conference I have attended in recent years. The people, the sessions, the community all helped make it a great conference. I&#8217;m not sure if I will be able to attend the next 360idev conference. I&#8217;m hoping to attend NSConference in February and I&#8217;m saving money for next year&#8217;s WWDC, which I definitely will be attending. But with luck I will hopefully make it to San Jose in April.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, has it really been 3 months since my last blog post. I&#8217;ve gotta work on improving that.</p>

<p>Speaking of improvements, a new enhancement is finally coming to Labor Mate. The next release will finally include a chart showing the duration and frequency of contractions over the last hour. Here is an sample of what the chart will look like:</p>

<p><a href='http://emberapp.com/users/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv3'><img alt='ContractionChartv3 hosted by Ember' src='http://emberapp.com/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv3/sizes/m.png' /></a></p>

<p>One thing to note is that intensity is not something captured by Labor Mate at the moment, so the chart will initially default the intensity level to 5. That is 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is a not so intense contraction and 10 is the OMG, GET THIS BABY OUT OF ME contraction. Here is the same chart with no intensity.</p>

<p><a href='http://emberapp.com/users/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv4'><img alt='ContractionChartv4 hosted by Ember' src='http://emberapp.com/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv4/sizes/m.png' /></a></p>

<p>Obviously these sample screen shots are not from an iPhone or iPod touch. I decided to prototype the chart in a Mac desktop app, which is what you see pictured here.</p>

<p>I hope to have the updated app submitted to Apple before the end of the month. Stay tune for more.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>stevenwt2 writes this about Labor Mate in his feedback at the App Store, &#8220;Used it throughout a night of contractions and it worked flawlessly. No crashes, no problems, and it was easy to keep track of an average. If there was anything to update about the app, I would want the &#8216;Summary&#8217; screen to be able to average based on a time period or number of contractions (average over last 5 contractions or over last hour, etc.) as an average over the entire night can be a little misleading. However, that is looking to the next version - good luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good news, stevenwt2. The average is already calculated based on the number of contractions.  In fact, the duration average shown on the summary screen is based on the last 3 contractions and the average frequency is based on the last 6 contractions.</p>

<p>Thanks for the great feedback and congratulations on the arrival of your new little one!!</p></div>

This is not the first time someone has asked for this feature or asked the question &#8220;how to delete.&#8221;  Good news is this feature already exists. Labor Mate provides 2 ways to delete a recorded contraction.</p>

<p>One option is to use the swipe delete feature common to many iPhone applications. Simply slide your finger across the item and a Delete button will appear. Touch the Delete button and the contraction is removed.</p>

<p>The other option is to tap the contraction item. This takes you to a second screen. At the bottom of this screen is a Delete Contraction button. Touch this button to delete the individual contraction.</p></div>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2009/04/07/quick-status-update-on-killink-csv-editor/">Quick Status Update on Killink CSV Editor </a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently dutchguru mentioned the limited, or &#8220;few&#8221;, software updates for Killink CSV Editor.  He is right.  There have been far too few updates recently and I have no one to blame but myself.  I started explaining the situation in my reply to dutchguru but decided a blog posting is also in order.</p>

<p>Why hasn&#8217;t there been any new updates to Killink CSV Editor in recent months?  And what of these new features I keep hearing about coming in Version 2.0?  The short answer is, I&#8217;ve been stuck on one problem, providing support for very large files.  This challenging problem has zapped all the time I have for working on Killink CSV Editor.  Hindsight now tells me I should have moved on but I didn&#8217;t and as a result I have been slow to push out new updates.</p>

<p>The longer answer not only includes the fact that I have been hung up on trying to solve this one problem but that I haven&#8217;t had as much time to work on Killink CSV Editor as I would like.  The reason for the lack of time includes a number of factors including adjusting to life as a new father.  But the number one factor is the need to make enough income to pay the bills, keep food on the table, keep a roof over the family&#8217;s head.  You know the story.  We&#8217;re all basically in the same boat.  It&#8217;s what responsible adults do.</p>

<p>Where does the time go?  After all I work for myself, right?  Yep, I do.  And as much as I love working solely on my own products each and every day, the sales number just are there&#8230;YET.  Product sales improve each year which means I get to spend more time working on my own software products.  But to help make sure bills are paid, food is on the table, etc, I must do custom software projects for other companies from time to time.  This is where a lot of my work time has been going in recent months, and until product sales improve to a point where I no longer need to do custom software work I have to balance my work time between White Peak Software products and custom software for other companies.</p>

<p>The good news is I&#8217;m on track to [hopefully] say bye-bye to custom software projects within the next 12 to 18 months.  When this happens I&#8217;ll be able to devote more time to my products, existing ones as well as new products I have brewing in my head.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the longer answer.  Great!  So now what?  First starters I&#8217;m going to stop work on very large file support.  This one feature is probably needed by less than 5 percent of the current user base while other features such as Unicode support is needed by a much larger percentage of users.  With this one item off my plate I can once again return to adding new features to Killink CSV Editor in a quick, timely manner.  I cannot yet provide a time line for the next update but I can tell you progress will finally be made.</p>

<p>Now that I have decided to drop very large file support my next step will be to complete the re-write of Killink CSV Editor.  The re-write is needed to support Unicode and to make it easier to include new features and push out more frequent updates.  The good news is the re-write is almost complete.  It was near completion last fall when I got side tracked by the very large file support problem.  Once the re-write is done I will push out a new beta update as soon as I can.</p></div>
