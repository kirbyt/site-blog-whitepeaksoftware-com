    <div class="entry-content"><p><img alt='' src='/images/blog/2009-11-06-iPhoneJapanese1.png' /></p>

<p>I recently went through the process of translating Labor Mate into 8 different languages. Unfortunately the phrase &#8220;Labor Mate&#8221; doesn&#8217;t translate well into other languages such as Japanese and Germany so the translators came up with new localized app names. The problem I had though was displaying the translated app name on the iPhone&#8217;s springboard.</p>

<p>After a bit of experimenting I finally got the translated app name to display. Turns out the steps are fairly simple. Here are the steps I took to localize the app name:</p>

<p>1. Added the property LSHasLocalizedDisplayName to Info.plist and set to True (mark the checkbox). Note that Xcode might change the property name to &#8220;Application has localized display name&#8221;.</p>

<p>2. Add a new strings file called InfoPlist.strings.</p>

<p>3. Make the file InfoPlist.strings localizable.</p>

<p>4. Add the languages that will have a translated app name.</p>

<p>5. For each localized version of the InfoPlist.strings file, add the follow string key/value pair:Â CFBundleDisplayName = &#8220;App Name&#8221;;</p>

<p>6. Be sure to set &#8220;App Name&#8221; to the translated value.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>

<p><img alt='Info.plist' src='/images/blog/2009-11-06-Info.plist.png' /></p>

<p><img alt='InfoPlist.strings' src='/images/blog/2009-11-06-InfoPlist.strings.png' /></p>

<p>Speaking of language translation, I hired the fine folks over at <a href='http://iphone-i18n.com/'>iphone-i18n.com</a> to translate the app description, keywords, and in-app strings for Labor Mate. I met Chuck and Judith of iphone-i18n.com at <a href='http://www.360idev.com/'>360iDev|Denver</a>. They impressed me with their knowledge of internationalizing and localizing applications as well as their specific technical how to knowledge for the iPhone.</p>

<p>If you are an iPhone developer looking to <a href='http://iphone-i18n.com/'>translate your iPhone application</a> into other languages then I highly recommend talking with Chuck and Judith at iphone-i18n.com.</p></div>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2009/10/13/360idev-denver-a-personal-review/">360idev Denver: A Personal Review</a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of weeks ago I attended <a href='http://www.360idev.com/'>360idev</a> in Denver. The conference was one of the best developer conferences I have ever attended and the best one I have attended in recent years. What made this conference so good? A number of things (in no particular order):</p>

<p>1) The people</p>

<p>2) The sessions</p>

<p>3) The Game Jam</p>

<p>4) The community (aka the people)</p>

<p>My conference experience started Saturday night when I met up with fellow iPhone developers from the Boston area. Prior to leaving for Denver I knew 1 other iPhone developer in the area, but by the time I left I had 6 new friends all building and publishing iPhone apps. Working from home for the last 5 years can get lonely so making new friends made the trip worth while even if the conference had suck, which it did not.</p>

<p>The conference kicked off on Sunday with a day of hands-on lab. This was actually Day 0 of the conference since these pre-conference sessions were held the day before the official conference start. I attended the advanced debugging and hacking the iPhone sessions. Both were amazing. I learned many new ticks in the debugging session, and I was blown away by <a href='http://www.saurik.com/'>Jay Freeman</a> who hacked the Maps app.</p>

<p>The bar by which all other conference sessions would be judged by me had been set on that day, and the bar was set high. Admittedly I expected the rest of the conference to not be nearly as good. Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>The next 3 days were packed with extremely helpful, useful, and insightful sessions. The sessions covered everything from business and marketing related topics to hands-on tech talks on topics such as Core Data, Core Animation, game development, and more. It&#8217;s hard to say what was my favorite session given that all the sessions I attended were outstanding sans 2 sessions. Those 2 sessions were still good, just not as good as the other sessions I attended.</p>

<p>A true highlight of the conference for me was the <a href='http://iphonegamejam.com/'>Game Jam</a>. The Game Jam was the brain child of <a href='http://gamesfromwithin.com/'>@SnappyTouch</a> and it was a total hit. The Game Jam was open to all, not just game developers. I&#8217;ve never done game development before but I&#8217;ve been interested in game development for quite some time now. So I attended. I joined forces with another Boston area developer. Our game ended up not being much, but that was fine. We had fun, and I totally enjoyed the experience. Just watching the other developers crank out some amazing work in the late hours of the night was a real thrill for me.</p>

<p>The number one lesson I got out of the Game Jam is to push myself beyond my comfort zone. I&#8217;ve been doing software development for more than half of my life and I&#8217;ve become comfortable with the type of apps I tend to write. The Game Jam reminded me of what it was like programming 20 years ago, back when I would write code just for the hell of it, when I would write tons of small programs just to learn something new or to trying something I thought was cool, and not worry if or how I could make money off the program. In some ways, you can say the Game Jam has re-kindled a lost spirit in me.</p>

<p>If I had to pick the one thing I liked the most about the conference I would have to say the sense of community. It has been a long time since I felt like a part of a community. This is due in part to me working from home for a number of years, but also in part to the difficulties finding a group of people who share a common interesting and passion. In ways it reminded me how I felt in the 90s attending BorCons and discovering the Delphi community. But this new iPhone developer community that I discovered at 360idev is different. Like me, almost everyone I met is an indie developer or is working for a small (2 to 5) person company. Also I was surprised, and a bit jealous, of the number of husband wife teams present at the conference.</p>

<p>As I said, 360idev Denver was the best developer conference I have attended in recent years. The people, the sessions, the community all helped make it a great conference. I&#8217;m not sure if I will be able to attend the next 360idev conference. I&#8217;m hoping to attend NSConference in February and I&#8217;m saving money for next year&#8217;s WWDC, which I definitely will be attending. But with luck I will hopefully make it to San Jose in April.</p></div>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2009/08/21/chart-coming-to-labor-mate-finally/">Chart Coming to Labor Mate...Finally</a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, has it really been 3 months since my last blog post. I&#8217;ve gotta work on improving that.</p>

<p>Speaking of improvements, a new enhancement is finally coming to Labor Mate. The next release will finally include a chart showing the duration and frequency of contractions over the last hour. Here is an sample of what the chart will look like:</p>

<p><a href='http://emberapp.com/users/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv3'><img alt='ContractionChartv3 hosted by Ember' src='http://emberapp.com/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv3/sizes/m.png' /></a></p>

<p>One thing to note is that intensity is not something captured by Labor Mate at the moment, so the chart will initially default the intensity level to 5. That is 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is a not so intense contraction and 10 is the OMG, GET THIS BABY OUT OF ME contraction. Here is the same chart with no intensity.</p>

<p><a href='http://emberapp.com/users/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv4'><img alt='ContractionChartv4 hosted by Ember' src='http://emberapp.com/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv4/sizes/m.png' /></a></p>

<p>Obviously these sample screen shots are not from an iPhone or iPod touch. I decided to prototype the chart in a Mac desktop app, which is what you see pictured here.</p>

<p>I hope to have the updated app submitted to Apple before the end of the month. Stay tune for more.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>stevenwt2 writes this about Labor Mate in his feedback at the App Store, &#8220;Used it throughout a night of contractions and it worked flawlessly. No crashes, no problems, and it was easy to keep track of an average. If there was anything to update about the app, I would want the &#8216;Summary&#8217; screen to be able to average based on a time period or number of contractions (average over last 5 contractions or over last hour, etc.) as an average over the entire night can be a little misleading. However, that is looking to the next version - good luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good news, stevenwt2. The average is already calculated based on the number of contractions.Â  In fact, the duration average shown on the summary screen is based on the last 3 contractions and the average frequency is based on the last 6 contractions.</p>

<p>Thanks for the great feedback and congratulations on the arrival of your new little one!!</p></div>

This is not the first time someone has asked for this feature or asked the question &#8220;how to delete.&#8221;Â  Good news is this feature already exists. Labor Mate provides 2 ways to delete a recorded contraction.</p>

<p>One option is to use the swipe delete feature common to many iPhone applications. Simply slide your finger across the item and a Delete button will appear. Touch the Delete button and the contraction is removed.</p>

<p>The other option is to tap the contraction item. This takes you to a second screen. At the bottom of this screen is a Delete Contraction button. Touch this button to delete the individual contraction.</p></div>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2009/04/07/quick-status-update-on-killink-csv-editor/">Quick Status Update on Killink CSV Editor </a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently dutchguru mentioned the limited, or &#8220;few&#8221;, software updates for Killink CSV Editor.Â  He is right.Â  There have been far too few updates recently and I have no one to blame but myself.Â  I started explaining the situation in my reply to dutchguru but decided a blog posting is also in order.</p>

<p>Why hasn&#8217;t there been any new updates to Killink CSV Editor in recent months?Â  And what of these new features I keep hearing about coming in Version 2.0?Â  The short answer is, I&#8217;ve been stuck on one problem, providing support for very large files.Â  This challenging problem has zapped all the time I have for working on Killink CSV Editor.Â  Hindsight now tells me I should have moved on but I didn&#8217;t and as a result I have been slow to push out new updates.</p>

<p>The longer answer not only includes the fact that I have been hung up on trying to solve this one problem but that I haven&#8217;t had as much time to work on Killink CSV Editor as I would like.Â  The reason for the lack of time includes a number of factors including adjusting to life as a new father.Â  But the number one factor is the need to make enough income to pay the bills, keep food on the table, keep a roof over the family&#8217;s head.Â  You know the story.Â  We&#8217;re all basically in the same boat.Â  It&#8217;s what responsible adults do.</p>

<p>Where does the time go?Â  After all I work for myself, right?Â  Yep, I do.Â  And as much as I love working solely on my own products each and every day, the sales number just are there&#8230;YET.Â  Product sales improve each year which means I get to spend more time working on my own software products.Â  But to help make sure bills are paid, food is on the table, etc, I must do custom software projects for other companies from time to time.Â  This is where a lot of my work time has been going in recent months, and until product sales improve to a point where I no longer need to do custom software work I have to balance my work time between White Peak Software products and custom software for other companies.</p>

<p>The good news is I&#8217;m on track to [hopefully] say bye-bye to custom software projects within the next 12 to 18 months.Â  When this happens I&#8217;ll be able to devote more time to my products, existing ones as well as new products I have brewing in my head.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the longer answer.Â  Great!Â  So now what?Â  First starters I&#8217;m going to stop work on very large file support.Â  This one feature is probably needed by less than 5 percent of the current user base while other features such as Unicode support is needed by a much larger percentage of users.Â  With this one item off my plate I can once again return to adding new features to Killink CSV Editor in a quick, timely manner.Â  I cannot yet provide a time line for the next update but I can tell you progress will finally be made.</p>

<p>Now that I have decided to drop very large file support my next step will be to complete the re-write of Killink CSV Editor.Â  The re-write is needed to support Unicode and to make it easier to include new features and push out more frequent updates.Â  The good news is the re-write is almost complete.Â  It was near completion last fall when I got side tracked by the very large file support problem.Â  Once the re-write is done I will push out a new beta update as soon as I can.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m happy to announce Labor Mate 1.3 is finally in the iPhone App Store as of last night.Â  The review time took longer than the time needed to make the code changes, but that was partly my fault.Â  I introduced a bug that crashed the app.Â  Luckily the crashing version of the app was rejected by Apple so that release never made it to users&#8217; iPhones and iPod touches.</p>

<p>This latest release adds two new features:</p>

<p>1. Swipe delete - Slide your finger across a contraction item and a delete button will appear. It&#8217;s fast, easy way to delete a contraction.</p>

<p>2. Easy-touch button - The entire timer area is now one big button.Â  Touch anywhere in the timer area to start and stop the timer.</p>

<p>If you are already a Labor Mate users then be sure to down this latest version free of charge. And if you are not then become a user.Â  Labor Mate only costs $0.99.Â  I also have a limited number of available version 1.3 <a href='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/main/labor-mate/faq'>promo codes</a> for taking.</p></div>

<p>This morning I installed the iPhone OS 3.0 SDK and tried running Labor Mate in the simulator.Â  I didn&#8217;t recompile it.Â  It was already installed from previous sessions. So guess what. It crashes on launch. How strange is that?Â  Coincidence? Me doesn&#8217;t think so.</p>

<p>Update: Definitely a coincidence. There is one particular scenarion that I failed to test, and sure enough the app is crashing in that scenarion. Apple&#8217;s review process saved me from an embarrassing moment.</p></div>
