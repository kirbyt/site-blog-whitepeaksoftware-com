<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2012/07/31/first-impressions-macbook-pro-with-retina-display.html">First Impressions: MacBook Pro with Retina Display</a></h1>
<div class="entry-content"><p>In July 2007 I bought a fully loaded MacBook Pro. It was by far the best computer I have ever owned. And that isn&#8217;t just my opinion. PC World said the Apple MacBook Pro was the <a href='http://www.pcworld.com/article/136649-3/in_pictures_the_most_notable_notebooks_of_2007.html'>fastest Windows Vista notebook</a> at the time.</p>

<p>My MacBook Pro was also the most expensive computer I have ever bought. The high price tag wasn&#8217;t because of the perceived &#8220;Mac tax.&#8221; The high price tag was due to hardware cost. In fact, I looked at what it would cost to buy the same set of hardware from Dell at the time, and Dell&#8217;s price was $200 more than Apple&#8217;s.</p>

<p>My MacBook Pro has served me well for 5 years, which is a long time especially for a laptop. But it has reached its limits. The machine, while still usable, is just too slow for the work I do daily. I might be able to squeeze out another year if I could bump up the RAM to 8 GB or even 16 GB, but sadly, that model only goes to 4 GB. (Yes, I know there is a non-Apple recommended way to bump up to 6 GB, but let&#8217;s face it. Five years is a long time for a laptop.) So nearly 5 years to the date, I got myself a new MacBook Pro. (My previous MBP arrived July 25, 2007, and my latest one arrived July 30, 3012.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s too early to say if I will get 5 years of service out of this latest MBP, but I&#8217;m hopeful I will. And while my latest MBP is expensive, it still costed less than the one I bought in 2007 - by nearly $700 if I remember correctly. Though admittedly I did not get the maxed out MBP this time around. I got the 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 with 16 GB RAM, 512 GB flash storage, and retina display.</p>

<p>My first impression of the new MacBook Pro: It&#8217;s a sweet machine.</p>

<p>It feels heavier than I expected, but it&#8217;s still lighter than my 2007 MBP. It&#8217;s super quiet especially compared to my 2007 MBP. My 2007 MBP&#8217;s fan runs non-stop when attached to the power cord. This started when I updated to Lion and has annoyed me ever since. (Thankfully my Bose noise canceling headphones drown out the fan noise from my old MBP.) And my new MBP doesn&#8217;t heat up like my old one does.</p>

<p>My new MBP is fast, really fast compared to my 2007 MBP. This is most noticeable for me when compiling projects in Xcode. A project that would take a minute and a half to do a clean compile now takes 10 seconds. And iPhoto, with my 40 GB library, is once again useable. iPhoto was so painfully slow on my other MBP that I only used it to import photos and that was it. But last night I was tagging faces, looking at photos from places, and doing some minor cropping and editing on my shinny, new MBP.</p>

<p>While I knew the new MBP would be faster, lighter, and better than my previous MBP, the one feature I was lukewarm on is the retina display. If the non-retina MBP supported 16 GB of RAM then I might have bought one of them instead of the retina MBP. However, after using my new MBP for a day, I so glad I went with the retina display. Text on the new retina display is crisp, clear, and much more readable than on the non-retina display. And as someone who has to stare at text all day, this was a welcome surprise for me. I was indifferent about the retina display before buying my MBP, but now, I can&#8217;t imaging buy a new MBP without the retina display.</p>

<p>The retina display also provides one additional benefit for me. I&#8217;m currently working on the second addition of my book <a href='http://amzn.to/ipadprogbook'>Learning iPad Programming</a>. My publisher prefers screenshots for figure images to be at 150 ppi minimum, but normal computer displays are only 72 ppi. With the new retina display, I can take screenshots that are 144 ppi. Still not quite 150 ppi, but a lot closer, which should make my publisher happier.</p>

<p>So after only a day of playing on the new MBP with retina display, was the purchase worth well for me? Absolutely. There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that going with the MBP with retina display was the right choice for me. That said, if my previous MBP were only a year or so old, I might have held off on the purchase until the price drops a bit. But for me, at this time, the new MBP with retina display is the idea machine for me. The 16 GB of RAM, faster CPU and flash storage, and of course the retina display are vast improvements needed for my daily work.</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend was <a href='http://voicesthatmatter.com/'>Voices That Matter</a> Seattle. It was my second time attending VTM and second time speaking. I have to say this latest installment of VTM was even better than the last one in Philly.</p>

<p>My conference weekend kicked off on Friday with a full day workshop learning <a href='http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/'>Cocos2D</a>. This workshop was full of juicy awesome goodness, and for the first time in my career I feel like I now know how to write a game. In fact I have a new game idea brewing in my head as I type this. <a href='http://twitter.com/rodstrougo'>Rod Strougo</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/rwenderlich'>Ray Wenderlich</a> did an outstanding job putting together and teaching the full day workshop.</p>

<p>VTM continued to impress for the next two days. Some highlights for me included:</p>

<p>* <a href='http://twitter.com/bmf'>Mike Lee&#8217;s</a> keynote. I was especially moved by the part where Mike talked about our wonderful iOS and Mac developer community.</p>

<p>* Hearing <a href='http://twitter.com/zaphodgjd'>Graeme Devine</a> talk on Game Center and the Art of Addictive Games and getting to meet him. We had some good chats. It wasn&#8217;t until later I found out <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Devine'>who he really is</a>.</p>

<p>* Meeting <a href='http://www.kevincallahan.org/'>Kevin Callahan</a> and getting the one-on-one demo of <a href='http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html'>Accessorizer</a>. This app is awesome and does so much to make you more productive in Xcode.</p>

<p>* And of course catching up with old friends and making new ones (too many to list here).</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href='http://twitter.com/vtm_iphone'>VTM organizers</a> for putting on a great event, and special thanks to <a href='http://twitter.com/chuckdude'>Chuck</a> for getting me from and to the airport.</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><p>White Peak Software suffered a major email server outage earlier today. Server hardware at the hosting provider died a horrible death causing the outage. I believe the outage started around 10:30 am Eastern and continued until almost 8:00 pm Eastern.</p>

<p>After a few hours and reports of emails bouncing back with &#8220;invalid email address&#8221; errors, I decided to move the White Peak Software mail server to a new hosting provider. This meant email was once again flowing even while the original hosting provider tried to solve the hardware problems.</p>

<p>Email seems to be stable again. However, if you sent an email to White Peak or me any time today and I have not responded then please resend the email. It&#8217;s likely the email fell into a black hole.</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I received my shinny, new iPad 2 yesterday. When I turned it on I immediately saw yellowish discolorations along the top, right, and bottom edges. The discoloration at the top right corner is the worse and is about the size of my thumb. I tweeted about the problem to see if others have seen the same issue. A friend pointed me to <a href='http://www.theipadfan.com/ipad-2-screen/'>this site</a> which describes the problem and shows a picture of the discoloration.</p>

<p>So apparently this is a problem with the new iPad 2, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a major problem. Nor do I think it&#8217;s a problem with iPad 2 only. Here&#8217;s why.</p>

<p>It seems that many iPads will show some slight discoloration when displaying an all black screen with full brightness while in the dark. I see this on my first generation iPads, so this is not a new problem with the iPad 2. And I don&#8217;t see this as a major problem because under normal use you do not see the discoloration. I have used my first generation iPads (I have two of them) for nearly a year, and I have never noticed this problem. I can only see it when I display an all black screen with full brightness while in the dark, which is not a normal use case scenario.</p>

<p>With that said, the problem with my new iPad 2 is different. Yes, it&#8217;s the same yellowish discoloration, but in my particular case the discoloration is noticeable when using the iPad under normal conditions. The discoloration is visible on my device when running apps with black backgrounds (such as Kindle and Instapaper) with the brightness set to a low level while sitting in a room with natural daytime light. This is why I have asked Apple for a replacement. I wouldn&#8217;t care about the discoloration if it wasn&#8217;t noticeable under normal use, but for my particular device it is noticeable under normal use.</p>

<p>So before you panic and think you have a defective iPad 2 because you can see some discoloration when looking at an all black screen with full brightness while in the dark, see if the discoloration is noticeable under normal conditions. I&#8217;m willing to bet your iPad is perfectly fine.</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><img align='left' src='http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Knapsack.png' />
<p>I&#8217;m very excited to announce a new partnership between <a href='http://outerlevel.com/'>Outer Level</a> and White Peak Software. Outer Level is the maker of great Mac and iOS apps including <a href='http://outerlevel.com/licensekeeper/'>LicenseKeeper</a>, <a href='http://outerlevel.com/bullfrog-mac/'>Bullfrog</a>, and (my personal favorite) <a href='http://outerlevel.com/knapsack/'>Knapsack</a>. Outer Level&#8217;s success over the last year has left Jon, founder and lead developer at Outer Level, with more work than he can handle by himself. So Jon has asked me to join the Outer Level development team to help out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very excited about this opportunity to work with one of the top Mac developer in the community. And while I have a lot to offer Jon and team, I will selfishly be learning a lot from Jon as I help with new development on Knapsack, Outer Level&#8217;s <a href='http://outerlevel.com/knapsack/'>travel app</a>.</p>

<p>What impact will this have on White Peak Software? None. I will continue working for White Peak Software as I have for the last 7 and a half years (Wow! It&#8217;s been that long?!). This partnership will, however, reduce my availability for consulting work, but this is a good thing as it fits within my long term goals for White Peak.</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I decided one of my apps should display placeholder text in a text view. Unfortunately UITextView does not have a placeholder property. I&#8217;ve always thought this is odd especially given the fact that UITextField has a placeholder property.</p>

<p>I googled to see what others have done. I found <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1328638/placeholder-in-uitextview'>some good approaches</a> but no one solution that I liked. So I decided to write my own borrowing from the various ideas of others. The end result is KTTextView.</p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/kirbyt/KTTextView'>KTTextView</a> derives from UITextView and enhances it with new features. At the moment the only new feature is the placeholder text. The <strong>placeholderText</strong> property works same as UITextField&#8217;s placeholder property. I also added the property <strong>placeholderColor</strong> in case an app has the need to use a color different then the default placeholder color.</p>

<p>KTTextView is hosted on <a href='https://github.com/kirbyt/KTTextView'>github</a>. The project includes a sample app showing how to use KTTextView. I plan to add more features as time allows. One feature I want to add is an option to display the text view in a rounded rectangle giving it a similar look to UITextField. In the meantime, I hope you find the KTTextView&#8217;s current implementation useful.</p></div>

<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/11/22/an-exciting-opportunity-or-a-nightmare-in-the-making.html">An Exciting Opportunity or a Nightmare in the Making?</a></h1>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I received an email in August from a large company. A gentleman from the company wanted to talk with me about an opportunity for White Peak Software and Labor Mate. The company wanted to rebrand Labor Mate as one of their own iOS apps. As part of the deal they would do various marketing campaigns including print ads, exposure on high traffic web sites, and announcements in email newsletters. The market efforts would potentially reach millions of people that I otherwise would not reach unless I invested large sums of my own money in my own marketing efforts. Needless to say, I was very excited.</p>

<p>In exchange for the additional exposure Labor Mate would receive, I would rebrand Labor Mate to look like an app from the large company and part of the net revenue from sales would be split. Best of all I remain owner of the app and I have final say in what goes into the app. The deal could be looked at, in some ways, as corporate sponsorship for Labor Mate. And I was stoked!</p>

<p>Over the next few months we negotiated the terms of the agreement. At the same time, we worked on rebranding Labor Mate. I was pleased with the final results, which was a much nicer looking Labor Mate. And the corporate branding was done in a very tasteful, non-intrusive manner. My only complaints, which were minor, were the desire to include a splash screen and the new look was a little too foo-foo looking for my liking. Still, I was excited about the opportunity.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until about a month ago that my opinions about the deal started changing from excitement to concerns. Contract negotiations were slow and becoming much more complex. Lawyers got involved turning a &#8220;no nonsense&#8221; agreement into a 3 year commitment with requirements for various liability insurance, errors and omissions insurance, service level agreements, and more. Assuming Labor Mate sales remain the same for first 12 months of the agreement, I would pay out roughly 25% of net revenue just in legal and insurance fees. The deal was no longer feeling like a great opportunity.</p>

<p>The slow progress on contract negotiations wasn&#8217;t the only thing changing my mind about the opportunity. I starting feeling as if I would not have final say in Labor Mate&#8217;s functionality. Also, receiving visual assets from the large company was slower then I&#8217;m use to, and the extra time needed for internal approval of the app before submitting to Apple was dragging. My concerns grew as a result. I set aside time to work on a White Peak Software products, and I often don&#8217;t have time or patience for these types of delays. Was this something I could expect in the coming years?</p>

<p>As the weeks went by I was starting to feel like the once great opportunity was raising too many warning flags indicating a nightmare in the making. Now please note, what I would call a nightmare business arrangement might be a walk in the park for others. I&#8217;m set in my ways. I&#8217;m an indie dev. I work from home. I make the decisions. I control what I work on and when. I have my own way of working, providing support, and determining success. And I don&#8217;t like making compromises on matters I disagree with. Anything that changes this for me is a nightmare in the making.</p>

<p>I started feeling the deal would mean giving up the control and freedom I enjoy as an indie dev. I felt I might be expected to drop everything when the large company decided changes were needed for the app. And I would need approval from the large company on any and all changes I want to make to the app. There was also a good amount of monthly reporting required, beyond financial reporting, that is not uncommon in Corporate America. The deal would mean I have a bond with a large corporate business partner regarding this one app and as my past has repeatedly shown, I don&#8217;t function well in Corporate America.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, there was no long term plan for the rebranded Labor Mate. What happens if the agreement is terminated early? Would that be the end of Labor Mate? Would I be required to pull it from the App Store or would I only need to remove the branding elements from the app? Would there be pressure to support other mobile platforms? And what if my vision for Labor Mate&#8217;s future differs from the large company&#8217;s vision? What would be my options going forward with Labor Mate?</p>

<p>There were too many unanswered questions for my liking. What was once an exciting opportunity was already causing undo stress and concerns for me. In the 3 months that past, things didn&#8217;t get better. They got worse, from my point of view. And if that can happen in a short 3 months, what would the next 3 years be like? My gut kept telling me it would be a 3 year nightmare.</p>

<p>Everyone I talked to about this deal agreed, it sounded like a great opportunity in the beginning but not so great in the end. Everyone also agreed I should walk away from the deal before it was too late.</p>

<p>So today I talked with my contacts at the large company. I explained that this opportunity wasn&#8217;t right for White Peak Software and that I am stepping away from the deal. To my surprise, it came as no surprise. I guess that means I did a good job communicating my concerns over the last couple of months. It also might mean they recognize indie devs and Corporate America don&#8217;t always mix.</p>

<p>I should note the individuals at the large company were friendly, understanding, and tried their best to make the deal work. They too were feeling the stress and were annoyed with the lengthy negotiations. In the end, though, I had to decide what&#8217;s best for my company, and this deal wasn&#8217;t in White Peak Software&#8217;s best interest.</p>

<p>Despite the distractions of this deal over the last 3 months, all is not lost. I did learn, and re-learn, some valuable lessons.</p>

<p>1. If it sounds too good to be true then it probably is.</p>

<p>2. Lawyers for the other side suck because they are not looking out for your best interest. Lawyers for your side are awesome because they are looking out for the your best interest.</p>

<p>3. Talk to friends, peers, business associates and colleagues, and anyone else who will listen about any major business deal. They will often provide insight and points of view you will never think of.</p>

<p>4. Don&#8217;t get distracted by too good to be true opportunities that do not fit into your business plan. And don&#8217;t try to make the opportunity fit into your business plan just because it sounds too good to pass up. It&#8217;s either a natural fit for your business or it is not.</p>

<p>5. Stand by your principles</p>

<p>6. It&#8217; okay to say &#8220;No&#8221; even if no comes 3 months down the road.</p>

<p>7. And lastly, if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s next for Labor Mate? I&#8217;m going to take the money I would have spent on extra insurance, hire a kick-ass designer, and get to work on Labor Mate 2.</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Isn&#8217;t not like I need a distraction from work, but I couldn&#8217;t resist this one. I saw a tweet about iDOS, a DOS emulator app just released for iPad and iPhone. For fear the app will be pulled from the App Store, I bought it right away. Besides, it&#8217;s only 99 cent.</p>

<p>I read a story about someone <a href='http://toucharcade.com/2010/10/26/idos/'>installing Windows 3.0 inside of iDOS</a>. Sounds cool but I&#8217;m not interested in Windows 3.0. Instead, I decided to install Turbo Pascal. Embarcadero recently posted <a href='http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20803'>Turbo Pascal v5.5 as a free download</a> so the first thing I did was to grab a copy of it. Next, I grabbed an <a href='http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html#Downloads'>unzip program</a> so I can unzip TP55.zip in iDOS. (Save time and <a href='ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/msdos/'>go here</a> to download unz552x3.exe.)</p>

<p>Here are the remaining steps I followed to get Turbo Pascal up and running on my iPad.</p>

<p>* Connect the iPad to iTunes.</p>

<p>* In iTunes, go to the Apps tab for the connected iPad and scroll down to the file sharing section.</p>

<p>* Drag and drop TP55.zip and unz552x3.exe to iDOS.</p>

<p>* Sync the device.</p>

<p>* Once sync is complete, launch iDOS on the iPad. You&#8217;ll find the two files in the root directory.</p>

<p>* Copy unz552x3.exe to a new directory, or just run it in the root directory. This will uncompress the unzip utility files. I prefer running it in a separate directory to keep the root clean.</p>

<p>* Unzip TP55.zip. This will create two directories, DISK1 and DISK2. Again, I copied TP55.zip to a temp directory before unzip.</p>

<p>* Run install.exe found in the DISK1 directory. If your experience is similar to mine, you will get a message saying to insert the oop/demos/bgi/doc diskette. I&#8217;m guessing the installer can&#8217;t find the directory DISK2.</p>

<p>* At this point, I aborted the install. Not to worry. Turbo Pascal&#8217;s IDE, compiler, etc have been installed.</p>

<p>* By default, the IDE can be found in c:\TP. The program file to run is turbo.exe.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it. Happy coding!</p>

<p>Update: If those not lucky enough to grab a copy of iDOS from the App Store, you can <a href='http://code.google.com/p/dospad/'>download the source code for DOSPad</a> and build your own version.</p>

<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2010/10/21/my-initial-thoughts-of-the-mac-app-store.html">My Initial Thoughts on the Mac App Store</a></h1>
<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday Apple announced the Mac App Store, which will be available in 90 days. The Mac App Store is modeled after the iOS App Store. The store provides customers a trusted way to buy and download safe, quality software for the Mac OS X desktop. As with the iOS App Store, software developers must submit their apps to Apple for review, <a href='http://developer.apple.com/appstore/mac/resources/approval/guidelines.html'>apps must adhere to a list of rules</a>, and Apple gets 30% of the app price for each unit sold.</p>

<p>My first impression when reading about the announcement was 30% is too high. E-commerce providers such as Fastspring and eSellerate charge a much lower percentage. But the Mac App Store does do a few things that other e-commerce providers do not. The Mac App Store has the potential to reach many more users given that the app will be available on the desktop. Also, the Mac App Store will host the download file. But when I think about it, none of this is new. The only thing new is Apple.</p>

<p>Download sites have existed for years. The <a href='http://pad.asp-software.org/spec/spec.php'>PAD specification</a>, which has been available for years, provides a mechanism for software vendors to publish app metadata and be discovered by download sites, and ultimately by customers. And many download sites and e-commerce providers provide hosting of the app. Even Microsoft gave it a try with its web-based app store concept called <a href='http://www.windowsmarketplace.com/'>Microsoft Marketplace</a>, which after many years is no more. So it seems to me, the only thing new and different about the Mac App Store is the review process.</p>

<p>Downloading desktop software from download sites can be risky. You never know if the software you download contains a virus or malware. Attempts such as pre-scanning software for viruses by download sites have been made to instill trust but at the end of the day it&#8217;s hard to trust software downloaded from these sites. The <a href='http://www.asp-software.org/'>Association of Software Professionals</a> have attempted tackling the trust issue for years and has had some success. Still, at the end of the day, gaining customer trust with an online business is challenging.</p>

<p>Personally, I never download software from download sites but I buy a lot of software online. I only buy and download software from the vendor&#8217;s own web site, and I&#8217;ll only do it when I feel I can trust the vendor. The vendor earns my trust by having a professional online presence, provides contact information with bonus points for having a physical address and phone number, offers a money back guarantee, and most importantly digitally signing the software with a certificate from a trusted CA. If you browse the White Peak Software web site, you&#8217;ll see I follow these trust rules myself.</p>

<p>Trust is important when doing business in the online world, and the Mac App Store will help gain customer trust. This should, in turn, help encourage customers who have never bought desktop software online to final do so. The added level of trust and the potential reach to new customers makes the 30% cut to Apple worth while in my opinion. But I still have concerns, from a developer&#8217;s point of view, about the Mac App Store.</p>

<p>Many existing, and popular, apps sold today including some from Apple will be rejected from the store based on the list of <a href='http://developer.apple.com/appstore/mac/resources/approval/guidelines.html'>review rules</a>. But a bigger concern for me is that software vendors wishing to sell through the Mac App Store as well as through their own company web site will be required to maintain two different versions of the same app. Mac App Store apps cannot be self updating, cannot be trial version, and cannot use its own licensing scheme. These three things are key components to selling desktop software on the Internet today. This means a software vendor wishing to sell an app through the Mac App Store as well as through its own company store must have two separate builds of the app, one build without the self updating, trial version, and licensing scheme for the Mac App Store, and one build containing these features for sell through one&#8217;s own online store.</p>

<p>Another concern I have with the Mac App Store is the lack of pricing and licensing options. For example, Killink CSV is a business app bought by individuals and large companies alike. By selling directly to the customer, I can offer various pricing and licensing options. I offer a volume discount on purchases. The more single user licenses you buy, the lower the per unit cost. I offer a site license option too, which allows customers to pay a lower price while being able to install the software on a greater number of computers. Then there are coupons. I use coupons to offer discount pricing for a variety of reasons. It&#8217;s doubtful the Mac App Store will support coupons in the next 90 days. Then there are affiliates. While sells from affiliates represents only a small portion of my product revenue, affiliates do bring in additional customers. Come to think of it, in a way, one could think of the Mac App Store as an affiliate with review process.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder&#8230;giving the fact that I have more control over pricing, can offer discounts, and run sales using coupons&#8230;will customers become annoyed when they pay one price for my app in the Mac App Store only to find out they could have saved money by buying directly? And how will customer support change with the introduction of the Mac App Store? I&#8217;m assuming Apple will not provide any customer information after a purchase to the software vendor. What happens when a customer calls or emails me about re-installing the app on a new computer? I&#8217;ll have to first find out how they purchased the app, through the Mac App Store or through my web site. I can see it now, a customer responds with, &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember.&#8221; And what about refunds? Direct purchases can be refunded, Mac App Store purchases, well, &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to talk with Apple.&#8221;</p>

<p>Overall, I can see the Mac App Store leading to confusion and delay.</p>

<p>Oh, and then there is the concern of paid upgrades. Many, if not most, desktop software vendors count on revenue earned by paid upgrades. Paid upgrades are currently not supported in the iOS App Store, so I have to think the same will be true of the Mac App Store.</p>

<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the trial versions of the app. A customer can come to my web site and download a free 30-day trial of my software. This gives the user time to evaluate the app before making a purchasing decision. This is not going to happen, at least not initially, with the Mac App Store. Will this lead to users demanding lower prices and if so will software vendors given in starting a new race to the bottom. I certainly hope not. Software vendors need to stay their ground and price their products based on the value of the app.</p>

<p>Will my app be rejected from the Mac App Store if I include in the app description, &#8220;Come to my web site to download a free 30-day trial&#8221;? And what of cross-platform apps? Say I write a version of Killink CSV for the Mac. According to the list of review rules, I cannot mention the availability of the Windows version in the app&#8217;s metadata. If I do, it will be rejected even if this is a key selling point of the app.</p>

<p>I welcome the Mac App Store. It has great potential for tapping into a customer base that otherwise would be un-tappable. But I worry the Mac App Store is not the right place for many desktop app and by not being in the Mac App Store sells will suffer. Only time will tell if the Mac App Store will help software vendors, especially the indie shops like White Peak Software, to succeed.</p></div>
