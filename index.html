    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2012/08/14/Prolonging-My-Laptops-Battery-with-FruitJuice/">Prolonging My Laptop's Battery with FruitJuice</a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>For more than 10 years my primary dev machines have been laptops. The mobility provided by a laptop has changed the way, and where, I work. However, an unfortunate downside of me using a laptop as my primary machine is the number of batteries I go through. On average a laptop battery will last me about a year before I need to order a replacement. It&#8217;s common for battery life to degrade some after a year, but for me it&#8217;s common to see &#8220;Service Battery&#8221; around the 1-year mark.</p>

<p>Why do I burn through so many laptop batteries? It&#8217;s the way I use my laptop.</p>

<p>I often times treat my laptop as a desktop leaving it plugged into power for days, and sometimes even weeks at a time. But laptops are not designed for this kind of usage. The battery, like a muscle in your body, needs to be exercised. For a lithium-ion battery - found in most if not all laptops today - this means <a href='http://www.ehow.com/how_7259005_condition-laptop-battery.html'>conditioning the battery</a>.</p>

<p>To condition a battery, you need to regularly run your laptop on battery power using only a portion of the battery&#8217;s power, and then charge the battery as often as possible before the battery fully discharges. After about 30 charge cycles you want to do a full discharge of the battery followed by a full recharge.</p>

<p>Whew! That&#8217;s a lot of work to exercise a laptop battery. Well okay, it&#8217;s not a lot of work, but it does require some discipline. And history has proven I don&#8217;t have the discipline to properly condition my laptop&#8217;s battery.</p>

<p>So now I&#8217;m faced with a dilemma. I have a shinny, new MacBook Pro that doesn&#8217;t have a swappable battery. The battery can be replaced, but it must be replaced by Apple. I can&#8217;t simply buy a replacement battery online and pop it in when I need it. So I&#8217;m trying to change my ways to prolong the battery life for my new MacBook Pro, and I&#8217;m using <a href='http://fruitjuiceapp.com'>FruitJuice</a> to help me along the way.</p>

<p><a href='http://fruitjuiceapp.com'>FruitJuice</a> is a combination Mac app and web service that helps extend the life of your laptop&#8217;s battery by guiding you through the battery conditioning steps. It works by not only reminding you to condition your battery, it steps you through the conditioning process with convention and helpful email and SMS notifications. And when you are between conditioning periods, you can use FruitJuice to see how well you are exercising your battery by alternating between running on battery power and charging the battery.</p>

<p><img alt='' src='/images/blog/2012-08-14-FruitJuice.png' /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s this last feature that I like the most. I find myself checking my plugged in percentage a few times a day to make sure I stay in the green zone. The green zone is the ideal combination of running on battery power and plugged into a power source. Hopefully a future version of FruitJuice will notify me when I’ve been out of the green zone for too long, reminding me to unplug and run off the battery. But until such feature exists, I’ll keep an eye on my plugged in percentage.</p>

<p>Using FruitJuice comes with another benefit. It keeps a complete history of battery usage and conditioning. This information can be useful when it’s time to ask Apple for a replacement battery, should you need to prove you have been operating your laptop based on <a href='http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html'>Apple’s own recommended usage and maintenance</a>.</p>

<p>FruitJuice comes with a free 30-day trial, and cost $9.99 per year for one computer. Each additional computer costs $4.99 per year. This is cheap when you compare it to the cost of a new battery, which costs me $129 the last time I bought one for my older MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>So is FruitJuice saving me money? It&#8217;s too early to tell since my MacBook Pro is only a couple of weeks old. But I&#8217;m hopeful that a year from now I will not see the dreaded &#8220;Service Battery&#8221; condition that I&#8217;ve seen over and over the past few years.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I was not asked or paid to do this review. I was an early beta tester for FruitJuice, and I continue to be a FruitJuice user.</p></div>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2012/07/31/first-impressions-macbook-pro-with-retina-display/">First Impressions: MacBook Pro with Retina Display</a></h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>In July 2007 I bought a fully loaded MacBook Pro. It was by far the best computer I have ever owned. And that isn&#8217;t just my opinion. PC World said the Apple MacBook Pro was the <a href='http://www.pcworld.com/article/136649-3/in_pictures_the_most_notable_notebooks_of_2007.html'>fastest Windows Vista notebook</a> at the time.</p>

<p>My MacBook Pro was also the most expensive computer I have ever bought. The high price tag wasn&#8217;t because of the perceived &#8220;Mac tax.&#8221; The high price tag was due to hardware cost. In fact, I looked at what it would cost to buy the same set of hardware from Dell at the time, and Dell&#8217;s price was $200 more than Apple&#8217;s.</p>

<p>My MacBook Pro has served me well for 5 years, which is a long time especially for a laptop. But it has reached its limits. The machine, while still usable, is just too slow for the work I do daily. I might be able to squeeze out another year if I could bump up the RAM to 8 GB or even 16 GB, but sadly, that model only goes to 4 GB. (Yes, I know there is a non-Apple recommended way to bump up to 6 GB, but let&#8217;s face it. Five years is a long time for a laptop.) So nearly 5 years to the date, I got myself a new MacBook Pro. (My previous MBP arrived July 25, 2007, and my latest one arrived July 30, 3012.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s too early to say if I will get 5 years of service out of this latest MBP, but I&#8217;m hopeful I will. And while my latest MBP is expensive, it still costed less than the one I bought in 2007 - by nearly $700 if I remember correctly. Though admittedly I did not get the maxed out MBP this time around. I got the 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 with 16 GB RAM, 512 GB flash storage, and retina display.</p>

<p>My first impression of the new MacBook Pro: It&#8217;s a sweet machine.</p>

<p>It feels heavier than I expected, but it&#8217;s still lighter than my 2007 MBP. It&#8217;s super quiet especially compared to my 2007 MBP. My 2007 MBP&#8217;s fan runs non-stop when attached to the power cord. This started when I updated to Lion and has annoyed me ever since. (Thankfully my Bose noise canceling headphones drown out the fan noise from my old MBP.) And my new MBP doesn&#8217;t heat up like my old one does.</p>

<p>My new MBP is fast, really fast compared to my 2007 MBP. This is most noticeable for me when compiling projects in Xcode. A project that would take a minute and a half to do a clean compile now takes 10 seconds. And iPhoto, with my 40 GB library, is once again useable. iPhoto was so painfully slow on my other MBP that I only used it to import photos and that was it. But last night I was tagging faces, looking at photos from places, and doing some minor cropping and editing on my shinny, new MBP.</p>

<p>While I knew the new MBP would be faster, lighter, and better than my previous MBP, the one feature I was lukewarm on is the retina display. If the non-retina MBP supported 16 GB of RAM then I might have bought one of them instead of the retina MBP. However, after using my new MBP for a day, I so glad I went with the retina display. Text on the new retina display is crisp, clear, and much more readable than on the non-retina display. And as someone who has to stare at text all day, this was a welcome surprise for me. I was indifferent about the retina display before buying my MBP, but now, I can&#8217;t imaging buy a new MBP without the retina display.</p>

<p>The retina display also provides one additional benefit for me. I&#8217;m currently working on the second addition of my book <a href='http://amzn.to/ipadprogbook'>Learning iPad Programming</a>. My publisher prefers screenshots for figure images to be at 150 ppi minimum, but normal computer displays are only 72 ppi. With the new retina display, I can take screenshots that are 144 ppi. Still not quite 150 ppi, but a lot closer, which should make my publisher happier.</p>

<p>So after only a day of playing on the new MBP with retina display, was the purchase worth well for me? Absolutely. There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that going with the MBP with retina display was the right choice for me. That said, if my previous MBP were only a year or so old, I might have held off on the purchase until the price drops a bit. But for me, at this time, the new MBP with retina display is the idea machine for me. The 16 GB of RAM, faster CPU and flash storage, and of course the retina display are vast improvements needed for my daily work.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend was <a href='http://voicesthatmatter.com/'>Voices That Matter</a> Seattle. It was my second time attending VTM and second time speaking. I have to say this latest installment of VTM was even better than the last one in Philly.</p>

<p>My conference weekend kicked off on Friday with a full day workshop learning <a href='http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/'>Cocos2D</a>. This workshop was full of juicy awesome goodness, and for the first time in my career I feel like I now know how to write a game. In fact I have a new game idea brewing in my head as I type this. <a href='http://twitter.com/rodstrougo'>Rod Strougo</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/rwenderlich'>Ray Wenderlich</a> did an outstanding job putting together and teaching the full day workshop.</p>

<p>VTM continued to impress for the next two days. Some highlights for me included:</p>

<p>* <a href='http://twitter.com/bmf'>Mike Lee&#8217;s</a> keynote. I was especially moved by the part where Mike talked about our wonderful iOS and Mac developer community.</p>

<p>* Hearing <a href='http://twitter.com/zaphodgjd'>Graeme Devine</a> talk on Game Center and the Art of Addictive Games and getting to meet him. We had some good chats. It wasn&#8217;t until later I found out <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Devine'>who he really is</a>.</p>

<p>* Meeting <a href='http://www.kevincallahan.org/'>Kevin Callahan</a> and getting the one-on-one demo of <a href='http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html'>Accessorizer</a>. This app is awesome and does so much to make you more productive in Xcode.</p>

<p>* And of course catching up with old friends and making new ones (too many to list here).</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href='http://twitter.com/vtm_iphone'>VTM organizers</a> for putting on a great event, and special thanks to <a href='http://twitter.com/chuckdude'>Chuck</a> for getting me from and to the airport.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>White Peak Software suffered a major email server outage earlier today. Server hardware at the hosting provider died a horrible death causing the outage. I believe the outage started around 10:30 am Eastern and continued until almost 8:00 pm Eastern.</p>

<p>After a few hours and reports of emails bouncing back with &#8220;invalid email address&#8221; errors, I decided to move the White Peak Software mail server to a new hosting provider. This meant email was once again flowing even while the original hosting provider tried to solve the hardware problems.</p>

<p>Email seems to be stable again. However, if you sent an email to White Peak or me any time today and I have not responded then please resend the email. It&#8217;s likely the email fell into a black hole.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>I received my shinny, new iPad 2 yesterday. When I turned it on I immediately saw yellowish discolorations along the top, right, and bottom edges. The discoloration at the top right corner is the worse and is about the size of my thumb. I tweeted about the problem to see if others have seen the same issue. A friend pointed me to <a href='http://www.theipadfan.com/ipad-2-screen/'>this site</a> which describes the problem and shows a picture of the discoloration.</p>

<p>So apparently this is a problem with the new iPad 2, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a major problem. Nor do I think it&#8217;s a problem with iPad 2 only. Here&#8217;s why.</p>

<p>It seems that many iPads will show some slight discoloration when displaying an all black screen with full brightness while in the dark. I see this on my first generation iPads, so this is not a new problem with the iPad 2. And I don&#8217;t see this as a major problem because under normal use you do not see the discoloration. I have used my first generation iPads (I have two of them) for nearly a year, and I have never noticed this problem. I can only see it when I display an all black screen with full brightness while in the dark, which is not a normal use case scenario.</p>

<p>With that said, the problem with my new iPad 2 is different. Yes, it&#8217;s the same yellowish discoloration, but in my particular case the discoloration is noticeable when using the iPad under normal conditions. The discoloration is visible on my device when running apps with black backgrounds (such as Kindle and Instapaper) with the brightness set to a low level while sitting in a room with natural daytime light. This is why I have asked Apple for a replacement. I wouldn&#8217;t care about the discoloration if it wasn&#8217;t noticeable under normal use, but for my particular device it is noticeable under normal use.</p>

<p>So before you panic and think you have a defective iPad 2 because you can see some discoloration when looking at an all black screen with full brightness while in the dark, see if the discoloration is noticeable under normal conditions. I&#8217;m willing to bet your iPad is perfectly fine.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><img src='/images/blog/2011-02-24-Knapsack.png' align='left' />
<p>I&#8217;m very excited to announce a new partnership between <a href='http://outerlevel.com/'>Outer Level</a> and White Peak Software. Outer Level is the maker of great Mac and iOS apps including <a href='http://outerlevel.com/licensekeeper/'>LicenseKeeper</a>, <a href='http://outerlevel.com/bullfrog-mac/'>Bullfrog</a>, and (my personal favorite) <a href='http://outerlevel.com/knapsack/'>Knapsack</a>. Outer Level&#8217;s success over the last year has left Jon, founder and lead developer at Outer Level, with more work than he can handle by himself. So Jon has asked me to join the Outer Level development team to help out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very excited about this opportunity to work with one of the top Mac developer in the community. And while I have a lot to offer Jon and team, I will selfishly be learning a lot from Jon as I help with new development on Knapsack, Outer Level&#8217;s <a href='http://outerlevel.com/knapsack/'>travel app</a>.</p>

<p>What impact will this have on White Peak Software? None. I will continue working for White Peak Software as I have for the last 7 and a half years (Wow! It&#8217;s been that long?!). This partnership will, however, reduce my availability for consulting work, but this is a good thing as it fits within my long term goals for White Peak.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided one of my apps should display placeholder text in a text view. Unfortunately UITextView does not have a placeholder property. I&#8217;ve always thought this is odd especially given the fact that UITextField has a placeholder property.</p>

<p>I googled to see what others have done. I found <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1328638/placeholder-in-uitextview'>some good approaches</a> but no one solution that I liked. So I decided to write my own borrowing from the various ideas of others. The end result is KTTextView.</p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/kirbyt/KTTextView'>KTTextView</a> derives from UITextView and enhances it with new features. At the moment the only new feature is the placeholder text. The <strong>placeholderText</strong> property works same as UITextField&#8217;s placeholder property. I also added the property <strong>placeholderColor</strong> in case an app has the need to use a color different then the default placeholder color.</p>

<p>KTTextView is hosted on <a href='https://github.com/kirbyt/KTTextView'>github</a>. The project includes a sample app showing how to use KTTextView. I plan to add more features as time allows. One feature I want to add is an option to display the text view in a rounded rectangle giving it a similar look to UITextField. In the meantime, I hope you find the KTTextView&#8217;s current implementation useful.</p></div>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>I received an email in August from a large company. A gentleman from the company wanted to talk with me about an opportunity for White Peak Software and Labor Mate. The company wanted to rebrand Labor Mate as one of their own iOS apps. As part of the deal they would do various marketing campaigns including print ads, exposure on high traffic web sites, and announcements in email newsletters. The market efforts would potentially reach millions of people that I otherwise would not reach unless I invested large sums of my own money in my own marketing efforts. Needless to say, I was very excited.</p>

<p>In exchange for the additional exposure Labor Mate would receive, I would rebrand Labor Mate to look like an app from the large company and part of the net revenue from sales would be split. Best of all I remain owner of the app and I have final say in what goes into the app. The deal could be looked at, in some ways, as corporate sponsorship for Labor Mate. And I was stoked!</p>

<p>Over the next few months we negotiated the terms of the agreement. At the same time, we worked on rebranding Labor Mate. I was pleased with the final results, which was a much nicer looking Labor Mate. And the corporate branding was done in a very tasteful, non-intrusive manner. My only complaints, which were minor, were the desire to include a splash screen and the new look was a little too foo-foo looking for my liking. Still, I was excited about the opportunity.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until about a month ago that my opinions about the deal started changing from excitement to concerns. Contract negotiations were slow and becoming much more complex. Lawyers got involved turning a &#8220;no nonsense&#8221; agreement into a 3 year commitment with requirements for various liability insurance, errors and omissions insurance, service level agreements, and more. Assuming Labor Mate sales remain the same for first 12 months of the agreement, I would pay out roughly 25% of net revenue just in legal and insurance fees. The deal was no longer feeling like a great opportunity.</p>

<p>The slow progress on contract negotiations wasn&#8217;t the only thing changing my mind about the opportunity. I starting feeling as if I would not have final say in Labor Mate&#8217;s functionality. Also, receiving visual assets from the large company was slower then I&#8217;m use to, and the extra time needed for internal approval of the app before submitting to Apple was dragging. My concerns grew as a result. I set aside time to work on a White Peak Software products, and I often don&#8217;t have time or patience for these types of delays. Was this something I could expect in the coming years?</p>

<p>As the weeks went by I was starting to feel like the once great opportunity was raising too many warning flags indicating a nightmare in the making. Now please note, what I would call a nightmare business arrangement might be a walk in the park for others. I&#8217;m set in my ways. I&#8217;m an indie dev. I work from home. I make the decisions. I control what I work on and when. I have my own way of working, providing support, and determining success. And I don&#8217;t like making compromises on matters I disagree with. Anything that changes this for me is a nightmare in the making.</p>

<p>I started feeling the deal would mean giving up the control and freedom I enjoy as an indie dev. I felt I might be expected to drop everything when the large company decided changes were needed for the app. And I would need approval from the large company on any and all changes I want to make to the app. There was also a good amount of monthly reporting required, beyond financial reporting, that is not uncommon in Corporate America. The deal would mean I have a bond with a large corporate business partner regarding this one app and as my past has repeatedly shown, I don&#8217;t function well in Corporate America.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, there was no long term plan for the rebranded Labor Mate. What happens if the agreement is terminated early? Would that be the end of Labor Mate? Would I be required to pull it from the App Store or would I only need to remove the branding elements from the app? Would there be pressure to support other mobile platforms? And what if my vision for Labor Mate&#8217;s future differs from the large company&#8217;s vision? What would be my options going forward with Labor Mate?</p>

<p>There were too many unanswered questions for my liking. What was once an exciting opportunity was already causing undo stress and concerns for me. In the 3 months that past, things didn&#8217;t get better. They got worse, from my point of view. And if that can happen in a short 3 months, what would the next 3 years be like? My gut kept telling me it would be a 3 year nightmare.</p>

<p>Everyone I talked to about this deal agreed, it sounded like a great opportunity in the beginning but not so great in the end. Everyone also agreed I should walk away from the deal before it was too late.</p>

<p>So today I talked with my contacts at the large company. I explained that this opportunity wasn&#8217;t right for White Peak Software and that I am stepping away from the deal. To my surprise, it came as no surprise. I guess that means I did a good job communicating my concerns over the last couple of months. It also might mean they recognize indie devs and Corporate America don&#8217;t always mix.</p>

<p>I should note the individuals at the large company were friendly, understanding, and tried their best to make the deal work. They too were feeling the stress and were annoyed with the lengthy negotiations. In the end, though, I had to decide what&#8217;s best for my company, and this deal wasn&#8217;t in White Peak Software&#8217;s best interest.</p>

<p>Despite the distractions of this deal over the last 3 months, all is not lost. I did learn, and re-learn, some valuable lessons.</p>

<p>1. If it sounds too good to be true then it probably is.</p>

<p>2. Lawyers for the other side suck because they are not looking out for your best interest. Lawyers for your side are awesome because they are looking out for the your best interest.</p>

<p>3. Talk to friends, peers, business associates and colleagues, and anyone else who will listen about any major business deal. They will often provide insight and points of view you will never think of.</p>

<p>4. Don&#8217;t get distracted by too good to be true opportunities that do not fit into your business plan. And don&#8217;t try to make the opportunity fit into your business plan just because it sounds too good to pass up. It&#8217;s either a natural fit for your business or it is not.</p>

<p>5. Stand by your principles</p>

<p>6. It&#8217; okay to say &#8220;No&#8221; even if no comes 3 months down the road.</p>

<p>7. And lastly, if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s next for Labor Mate? I&#8217;m going to take the money I would have spent on extra insurance, hire a kick-ass designer, and get to work on Labor Mate 2.</p></div>
