         <h2><a href="/2009/10/13/360idev-denver-a-personal-review/">360idev Denver: A Personal Review</a></h2>
 
<p>A couple of weeks ago I attended <a href='http://www.360idev.com/'>360idev</a> in Denver. The conference was one of the best developer conferences I have ever attended and the best one I have attended in recent years. What made this conference so good? A number of things (in no particular order):</p>

<p>1) The people</p>

<p>2) The sessions</p>

<p>3) The Game Jam</p>

<p>4) The community (aka the people)</p>

<p>My conference experience started Saturday night when I met up with fellow iPhone developers from the Boston area. Prior to leaving for Denver I knew 1 other iPhone developer in the area, but by the time I left I had 6 new friends all building and publishing iPhone apps. Working from home for the last 5 years can get lonely so making new friends made the trip worth while even if the conference had suck, which it did not.</p>

<p>The conference kicked off on Sunday with a day of hands-on lab. This was actually Day 0 of the conference since these pre-conference sessions were held the day before the official conference start. I attended the advanced debugging and hacking the iPhone sessions. Both were amazing. I learned many new ticks in the debugging session, and I was blown away by <a href='http://www.saurik.com/'>Jay Freeman</a> who hacked the Maps app.</p>

<p>The bar by which all other conference sessions would be judged by me had been set on that day, and the bar was set high. Admittedly I expected the rest of the conference to not be nearly as good. Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>The next 3 days were packed with extremely helpful, useful, and insightful sessions. The sessions covered everything from business and marketing related topics to hands-on tech talks on topics such as Core Data, Core Animation, game development, and more. It&#8217;s hard to say what was my favorite session given that all the sessions I attended were outstanding sans 2 sessions. Those 2 sessions were still good, just not as good as the other sessions I attended.</p>

<p>A true highlight of the conference for me was the <a href='http://iphonegamejam.com/'>Game Jam</a>. The Game Jam was the brain child of <a href='http://gamesfromwithin.com/'>@SnappyTouch</a> and it was a total hit. The Game Jam was open to all, not just game developers. I&#8217;ve never done game development before but I&#8217;ve been interested in game development for quite some time now. So I attended. I joined forces with another Boston area developer. Our game ended up not being much, but that was fine. We had fun, and I totally enjoyed the experience. Just watching the other developers crank out some amazing work in the late hours of the night was a real thrill for me.</p>

<p>The number one lesson I got out of the Game Jam is to push myself beyond my comfort zone. I&#8217;ve been doing software development for more than half of my life and I&#8217;ve become comfortable with the type of apps I tend to write. The Game Jam reminded me of what it was like programming 20 years ago, back when I would write code just for the hell of it, when I would write tons of small programs just to learn something new or to trying something I thought was cool, and not worry if or how I could make money off the program. In some ways, you can say the Game Jam has re-kindled a lost spirit in me.</p>

<p>If I had to pick the one thing I liked the most about the conference I would have to say the sense of community. It has been a long time since I felt like a part of a community. This is due in part to me working from home for a number of years, but also in part to the difficulties finding a group of people who share a common interesting and passion. In ways it reminded me how I felt in the 90s attending BorCons and discovering the Delphi community. But this new iPhone developer community that I discovered at 360idev is different. Like me, almost everyone I met is an indie developer or is working for a small (2 to 5) person company. Also I was surprised, and a bit jealous, of the number of husband wife teams present at the conference.</p>

<p>As I said, 360idev Denver was the best developer conference I have attended in recent years. The people, the sessions, the community all helped make it a great conference. I&#8217;m not sure if I will be able to attend the next 360idev conference. I&#8217;m hoping to attend NSConference in February and I&#8217;m saving money for next year&#8217;s WWDC, which I definitely will be attending. But with luck I will hopefully make it to San Jose in April.</p>
