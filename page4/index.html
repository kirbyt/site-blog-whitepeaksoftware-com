    <div class="entry-content"><p>At long last, a new theme is coming to Hey Peanut. Hey Peanut 1.3 was submitted to Apple today. This update includes a new safari theme for toddlers to enjoy. There is a hippo, giraffe, zebra, and a friendly lion. Also included in this update are all new animal sounds recorded from actual animal.</p>

<p>Previous releases of Hey Peanut used family-made sounds. What do I mean by “family-made” sounds? Well, the animal sounds were recordings of my wife and me attempting to mimic each of the farm animals. The sounds were silly but lacked a certain level of professionalism. Hey Peanut 1.3 will use all new sounds, and this time the animal sounds are the actual sounds from real animals, with one exception. A giraffe doesn’t really make a sound, so in Hey Peanut the giraffe sounds like a giggling kid. Of course, that kid giggling is my son, <a href="http://www.rowanturner.net/">Rowan</a>, so there is still a family touch in this new release.</p>

<p>Hey Peanut 1.3 should be available for download from the App Store very soon. Meanwhile, keep an eye on the White Peak Software Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/whitepeak">@whitepeak</a>, for promo codes to redeem a free copy of Hey Peanut (U.S. App Store only).</p>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>Life has been crazy busy over the last week but fun at the same time. I’m wrapping up a client project, and last week I spoke about iPad programming at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/newyork-iphone-developers/">NYC iPhone Developer Meet-up</a>. The next day I followed up the talk with a one-day training class on learning iPad programming. Thanks goes out to <a href="http://twitter.com/juliobarros">Julio Barros</a> of <a href="http://www.e-string.com/">E-String</a> for keeping me busy last week, I mean for giving me the opportunity to talk and teach.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting things that happened last week was being interviewed by a reporter from the largest news service in China. Here’s a <a href="http://yfrog.com/msa3yxj">picture from the interview</a>, and yes, I look like a zombie in the picture. The reported asked some really good questions, and I think the interview went really well. But it’s doubtful I’ll ever see the interview since it will only air in China and the interview is unlikely to be available online. Still, it was fun to do.</p>

<p>A highlight from last week was seeing friends, old and new, Thursday night for drinks after the meet up. Made me realize how much I miss living in New York.</p>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend asked if I would put together a sample iOS app that shows how to display a stopwatch timer like the one used in Labor Mate. It seemed like a fun exercise to break up the night, so I said, “Sure, why not.” </p>

<p>I decided others might find the sample source code useful so I posted the project to <a href="http://github.com/kirbyt/SimpleTimer">github</a> for all to enjoy. The piece devs might find interesting is the KTStopwatch class. This is a simplified version of the class I use in Labor Mate. It supports wall clock and elapsed time.</p>

<p>The source code is licensed using The MIT License, so do with it what you like. Enjoy.</p>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>Jonathan Kardos has an excellent article on Boston Innovation explaining <a href="http://bostinnovation.com/2010/07/08/how-to-find-a-mobile-app-developer-in-boston/">how to find a mobile app developer in Boston</a>. <a href="http://nshappyhour.org">NSHappyHour</a> even gets a mention, which is great. But one thing left out of Jonathan’s article are national events such as <a href="http://360idev.com">360idev</a>. </p>

<p>Speaking from personal experience, attending events like 360idev is a great way to not only meet and network with developers but for developers to find work, whether they are looking for a permanent position or contract work. This is one of the many reasons I return to 360idev event after event, and why I will be at the next one in Austin TX on November 7th through the 10th.</p>

    <div class="entry-content"><p>Tags: app store,
Last month I mentioned my <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/06/01/sales-are-down-but-revenue-is-up/">experiment with the pricing</a> for Labor Mate to see what effects, if any, a price increase will have. The initial results were interesting. The number of units sold went down, but revenue had gone up. On the surface it seems the price increase was a success, but I needed more data.</p>

<p>I increased the price of Labor Mate by $1 on May 15, going from $0.99 to $1.99. By increasing the price on May 15, I was able to compare the first half of the month with the second half. And as I mentioned in the previous <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/06/01/sales-are-down-but-revenue-is-up/">post</a> revenue had indeed gone up. But I was curious to see if this would continue and what might be the long term effects, so I left Labor Mate at $1.99. After all, I made more money in May as a result of the price increase.</p>

<p>June is over and the sales numbers are in. I’m now able to compare a full month of sales (for June) at the higher $1.99 price to a full month of sales (for April) at the lower $0.99 price. And I can compare these numbers to May’s numbers. The results might be surprising to some, but are inline with what I secretly thought would happen.</p>

<p>In June, Labor Mate earned a whooping $31.94 more money than in April, and it earned $30.90 <strong>less</strong> compared to May. In April, Labor Mate averaged $35 per day. The average was $37 per day in May, and only $36 per day in June. </p>

<p>Revenue from Labor Mate has been on a slow but steady increase since it was first released back in 2008. Though I cannot prove it, based on past trends, my gut tells me Labor Mate would have likely hit June’s revenue number in May without the price increase. And my gut, again based on the trend, says June would have probably hit May’s number without the price increase. In other words, while the price increase did improve Labor Mate’s revenue, the amount of additional revenue resulting from the price increase is actually no different from the slow and steady increase in revenue I was already seeing at the lower, 99 cent price point. As a matter of fact, I saw a bigger jump in revenue between March and April, with April bringing in a whooping $175.71 more than March.</p>

<p>I’m now convinced the price increase did little to improve revenue, and actually the price increase likely did more harm than good. Prior to the price increase Labor Mate was ranked in the Top 100 in the Health and Fitness category for a number of different countries including the U.S. Today Labor Mate is no were near ranking in the Top 100 in most stores.</p>

<p>Another negative effect caused by the price increase is that fewer people are now using Labor Mate. As I noted in the previous <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/06/01/sales-are-down-but-revenue-is-up/">post</a>, the number of daily downloads dropped. This means fewer people are buying Labor Mate, which in turns means fewer people are using it. I believe Labor Mate’s slow but steady raise was due in part to word of mouth advertising. Now that there are fewer new moms and dads buying and using Labor Mate, there are fewer people recommending Labor Mate to other new moms and dads. And I admit, ignoring price for a moment, I’m a little disappointed that fewer people are using the app. A part of me prefers selling at a lower price point so more mom and pops to be will use it. (Hmm, maybe I should release a free, iAd supported version.)</p>

<p>So what’s next? I’ve thought about dropping the price back down to 99 cents, but this could lead to a backlash from the folks who purchased Labor Mate over the last 6 weeks. Plus, $1.99 is still cheaper than a large cup of Starbucks coffee. The better idea, and the one I have been planning all along, is to continue improving Labor Mate and make it stand out above the other 99 cent copy cats. This includes leaving the price at $1.99 for now. After all, as one recent new user said to me in email, “it is a very practical and intuitive app and certainly justified at $1.99.”</p>

My hope is I’m able to write blog posts from my Mac using <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> and have a link to the post auto-magically posted to <a href="http://twitter.com/kirbyt">my Twitter account</a>.
