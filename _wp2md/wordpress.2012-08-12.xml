		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the new White Peak Software blog.

I decided it's time to separate <a href="http://www.thecave.com/">my personal blog</a> from the <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/">company blog</a>.  When I first started White Peak Software, back in November 2003, I had separate blogs but it was difficult at the time to separate what belonged on the personal blog and what belonged on the company blog.  I tried a number of different tricks including syndicating each blog to the other.  Ultimately I decided to consolidate and use a single blog.  But White Peak Software is a different company today then it was back then.

Today White Peak Software sells products.  Yes, services are still available but software products are the company's primary focus.  And product specific blog postings don't necessarily make sense on my personal blog.  Hence the start of this company focused blog.]]></content:encoded>

You can edit the text directly in the cell. You could edit the text in the editor line at the top of the edit windows. Both approaches work but it's still a bit cumbersome when editing a large amount of text. The better approach is to use the Cell Editor window.

To access the Cell Editor window, select the cell to edit then press Ctrl+Enter. This will pop open the Cell Editor window. Or you can press the ellipsis button found at the end of the editor line. Once the Cell Editor window is open you can easily edit the text. You can resize the window making it easier to view and edit the text. And you can even turn on and off word wrapping.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When something goes bad in SMTP Diagnostics or Killink CSV you should see the standard error report window (as shown below). By "bad" I mean some unexpected error has occurred within the program. Ideally you will never see the standard error report window but given the wide variety of computer systems, configurations, favors of Windows operating systems, and so on you just never know what will happen with the program is released out into the wild.

<a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/errorreport.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29" title="Standard Error Report Window" src="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/errorreport.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="362" /></a>

So what should you do if you see the standard error report window? The best thing you can do is click the <strong>Send </strong>button. This will send the error report to the White Peak Software tracking database and I receive an immediate alert.  The information contained in the error report will help me trouble shoot the problem faster which means getting the fix completed sooner.  You can also include additional notes with the error report by adding your comments to the "What were you doing when the problem happened?" text area.

Also, you can optionally include your email address. In doing so you will receive a return email with a case number and URL. This case number and URL allows you to follow the progress of the work to resolve the issue.

So if you ever see the standard error report window, and I hope you never do, please send the report. This will help make the program that much better.]]></content:encoded>

I'm very happy to announce that <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/labormate">Labor Mate</a>, a specialized stopwatch designed to track a woman's labor contractions on the iPhone and iPod touch, is now available for purchase from the iPhone App Store.

Labor Mate is an easy-to-use stopwatch for the iPhone and iPod touch that tracks a woman's labor contractions with a simple push of a button.  With Labor Mate you can view the length of each contraction as well as the time between contractions.  You can also view the average length for contractions and the average time between contractions, which is helpful in determining when it is time to call the doctor or head off to the hospital.

Labor Mate cost $0.99 USD and is available for purchase through the <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=293822973&amp;mt=8">iPhone App Store</a>.

		<title>Still Waiting on Labor Mate Update 1.1.1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[First let me say "Arghhhhh!"  Okay, that helped a little.

At the beginning of the week I saw that 2 Labor Mate users requested new features.  The 2 features are:
<ul>
	<li>Display the date and time of the contraction.</li>
	<li>Add ability to email contraction log.</li>
</ul>
Always being the one who wants to keep customers happy I implemented these 2 features right away.  I posted the update to Apple and it has been waiting in the review queue for the last few days.  While waiting in review I discovered and fixed a memory leak.  It was a minor leak but a leak nontheless.

Since the previous update, version 1.1, was still in the review queue I decided to manually reject it and post the latest and greatest, version 1.1.1.  This has the 2 requested features and the memory leak fix.  But now I'm encountering another issue.

It seems by manually rejecting the previous update I have now prevented myself from being able to post a new update to the application.  Frustrating to say the least.  Users have requested new features.  I implemented those new features immediately.  And after 4 days those new features are still not in the hands of users.

I have contacted Apple about the issue.  As soon as the issue is resolve I will post the latest update, version 1.1.1.  And once it has been reviewed, which hopefully will not take long, users will be able to update their copy.  Stay tune for more.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Update:</span> The update was finally resubmitted as version 1.1.  Hopefully it will be available in the App Store soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've talked about the next major release for Killink CSV Editor for a long time now and I'm sure the one reader out there is wondering, "Where is Killink CSV Editor 2.0?"  Well, it's coming.  Bet you didn't see that one coming.  Seriously though, I am activity working on version 2.0 of my favorite csv editor.  Version 2.0 is basically a re-write of the previous version which is why it is taking so long to complete.  Unfortunately I can't give a time frame for the release of version 2 but I'm hoping to have the first beta ready sometime soon.  Post a comment to this blog entry or send me an <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/contacts">email </a>if you are interested in beta testing Killink CSV Editor 2.0.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I made a somewhat embarrassing mistake. I forgot to post version 1.13 of Killink CSV Editor.  I've been working on version 2 and between that and other things my mind has been elsewhere.  Still no excuse for not getting this version out sooner especially considering that it contains the bug fix for the find and replace feature.  I sincerely apologize to the Killink CSV users out there for this delay.

With that said, I'm happy to announce the immediated availability for version 1.13 of the Killink CSV Editor. This update is free to all licensed users and contains the following updates:
<ul>
	<li>Fixes the find and replace <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/forums/Topic275-12-1.aspx">bug</a>.</li>
	<li>Adds the shortcut key Ctrl+Home to move to the top left most cell.</li>
	<li>Adds the shortcut key Ctrl+End to the move the bottom right most cell.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am slowly but surely making progress on version 2 of Killink CSV Editor. I'm focusing most of my attention right now on huge (aka, very large) file support.  You know, files greater than 1GB.  My goal is to support up to 4GB file sizes under the 32-bit version of Windows XP and Vista.  However, a major challenge is how to handle sorting.  Image opening a very large file, say 3GB, highlighting columns B, D, and G, and sorting on all three columns.  With what will most likely be millions and millions of rows in the file, sorting is going to be a little slow, so I need to really ramp up the sort algorithm to ensure descent performance.  And I need to make sure memory usage is low at the same time.  Definitely fun challenges to tackle with version 2.]]></content:encoded>

<span id="BugEvents">I have filled a report with McAfee alerting them of the issue.  Unfortunately there is no good workaround to the problem short of not using McAfee, but I do <strong>not</strong> recommend turning off virus protection for Windows users.  I will provide updates as I get them from McAfee.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span id="BugEvents">Great news!  As of this morning, December 25, McAfee has resolved the mis-identification issue affecting Killink CSV Editor.  Customers effected by this problem should update McAfee with the latest virus protection update then re-install Killink CSV Editor.

The re-install of Killink CSV Editor is necessary since McAfee forcibly removed the program file killinkcsv.exe.  Optionally, you may be able to restore the program through the McAfee Security Center but I cannot guarantee this will work since individual configurations of McAfee may be different.

You can download the latest version of Killink CSV Editor from <a href=" http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv-download.aspx">here</a>.</span>

<span id="BugEvents">Sorry for any inconvenience this problem may have caused.  Hopefully it will not happen again.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Work on the new major release for Killink CSV Editor continues.  It is taking me much longer than expected but that seems common in the world of software development.  Having support for very large files, i.e., file size up to 4 GB, in version 2 is important to me and that is the reason for the delay.  The number one reported problem with version 1 is "out of memory" errors which is caused by working with large files.  My goal is to eliminate this error with version 2.

There is still no time framework for the release of version 2.  I want to say the first beta release will be ready soon but I have been saying that for a long time.

For those considering purchasing vesion 1 today but worried about being charged for upgrading to version 2, you do not need to worry.  Version 2 will be a free update for all licensed version 1 users.  This is my way of saying thank you to the customers who have supported Killink CSV Editor during its initial release.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The next release of Labor Mate, the labor contraction stopwatch for the iPhone and iPod touch, is nearly complete. The new release will include a new icon, some changes to the user interface, and some new functionality including being able to delete an individual contraction and adding notes to a contraction. But more importantly are the number of improvements behind the scenes.

A number of memory leaks have been fixed, and areas such as scrolling have been improved. It's fair to say that this release of Labor Mate is almost a complete re-write of the original. This is a good thing because it will enable me to add new features faster in the future.

To those of you whom I told the next release would be available two weeks ago, sorry for the delay and thanks for your patience.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At long last Labor Mate 1.2 is in the App Store.  Only 6 weeks later then I originally hoped, but better late then never. Why did it take so long? Good question.

The version 1.2 release of Labor Mate took longer then expected because it is basically a re-write from the original. I probably should have labeled it version 2.0 but I decided against it because there are only a handful of new features.  The re-write was needed to give the app greater stability especially in low memory conditions.  The re-write will also make it easier for me to add new features going forward.

So what new features are included? Well, my favorite is the new contraction detail screen that allows users to enter notes about the contraction or delete the contraction from the log.  Adding notes will be handy for when you need to remember something about the particular contraction.  And yes, the notes are included in the email that is sent from Labor Mate.

<img align="left" style="margin-left: 6px; margin-right: 6px;" src="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/main/static/images/labor-mate/laborMate.png" alt="" width="93" height="94" />Some users might notice the new app icon.  Jeff and Michael over at <a href="http://ocupop.com/">Ocupop</a> did an outstanding job coming up with the new icon, which really captures the primary purpose of Labor Mate.  I highly recommend these guys if you are looking for a design company.

What's next? I already have ideas for the next release of Labor Mate. The top priority is charting, or a graph representing a set of contractions over time. I have a couple of other ideas too but I'm keeping those to myself at the moment. I want to make sure they are doable before making any promises.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week I flipped the switch on the White Peak Software website rolling out the new site design.  If you are reading this in a RSS feed reader then pop over to <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">whitepeaksoftware.com</a> to check out the new website design.  The new design was done by Michael and Jeff over at <a href="http://ocupop.com/">Ocupop</a>, the same design company that designed the new Labor Mate app icon.  I highly recommend these guys.

The roll out of the new website did not go as smooth as I had hoped, but it did go well.  A lot of work was done behind the scenes so the roll out could potentially have had many more problems then it did.  The site was moved from Microsoft Windows server running IIS to a new Ubuntu (Linux) server running apache2.  This meant I needed to copy over a number of download files, pad files, xml version files, and so on.  It also meant I needed to map old URLs to new URLs so bookmarks, old links, and so on take the  visitor to the correct web page.  This caused at least 1 known hiccup for a customer who had just purchased a license for SMTP Diagnostics and was trying to download the latest version as I was rolling out the new website.

In addition to moving the site to the new server I migrated the website application from ASP.NET/C# to <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> with <a href="http://web2py.com/">web2py</a>.  This is actually something I'm very excited about.  The original system was messy and adding new features to the application was not only a pain but time consuming as well.  Moving to Python and web2py allows me to reduce the amount of source code needed to run the website.  And going forward I will be able to add new content and features faster. For instance, I can finally incorporate a lost license key retrieval feature (coming soon) and I can build a better order management backend system needed to manage orders.  Good things for both you the customer and me.

The new look also meant a new look for the store front and blog sites.  The store front gave me trouble due to some limitation in the ecommerce provider's template engine.  I'm not happy with the final results but at least the store front is functional.  And the typical site visitor will probably never notice the minor differences between the main site and the store front.

So as you can see a number of things were included in the roll out beyond just a new look.  The site was moved to a new server running a different operating system.  The code base was moved to a new programming language and platform.  And a new look was applied to the website, store front, and blog. [Note: I still need to update the <a href="http://forum.whitepeaksoftware.com/forums/">support forums</a> with the new look, but that's a topic for a different posting.]

Despite the number of things that had to happen, I felt the roll out for the new site went as well as can be expected. As I said I wish it had been a bit smoother but there could have been a lot more problems.  The lesson learned from the experience: Don't try to do so much in a single roll out.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I received an email from Apple today saying that the recent submission of Labor Mate 1.3 has been rejected due to a crash. The crash apparently is happening during the launch. Now of course I went through extensive testing with the app prior to submitting it and my debug and release builds never crashed. That was until today.

This morning I installed the iPhone OS 3.0 SDK and tried running Labor Mate in the simulator.  I didn't recompile it.  It was already installed from previous sessions. So guess what. It crashes on launch. How strange is that?  Coincidence? <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Me doesn't think so.</span>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Update</span>: Definitely a coincidence. There is one particular scenarion that I failed to test, and sure enough the app is crashing in that scenarion. Apple's review process saved me from an embarrassing moment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce Labor Mate 1.3 is finally in the iPhone App Store as of last night.  The review time took longer than the time needed to make the code changes, but that was partly my fault.  I introduced a bug that crashed the app.  Luckily the crashing version of the app was rejected by Apple so that release never made it to users' iPhones and iPod touches.

This latest release adds two new features:
<ol>
	<li>Swipe delete - Slide your finger across a contraction item and a delete button will appear. It's fast, easy way to delete a contraction.</li>
	<li>Easy-touch button - The entire timer area is now one big button.  Touch anywhere in the timer area to start and stop the timer.</li>
</ol>
If you are already a Labor Mate users then be sure to down this latest version free of charge. And if you are not then become a user.  Labor Mate only costs $0.99.  I also have a limited number of available version 1.3 <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/main/labor-mate/faq">promo codes</a> for taking.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Quick Status Update on Killink CSV Editor </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently dutchguru mentioned the limited, or "few", software updates for Killink CSV Editor.  He is right.  There have been far too few updates recently and I have no one to blame but myself.  I started explaining the situation in my reply to dutchguru but decided a blog posting is also in order.

Why hasn't there been any new updates to Killink CSV Editor in recent months?  And what of these new features I keep hearing about coming in Version 2.0?  The short answer is, I've been stuck on one problem, providing support for very large files.  This challenging problem has zapped all the time I have for working on Killink CSV Editor.  Hindsight now tells me I should have moved on but I didn't and as a result I have been slow to push out new updates.

The longer answer not only includes the fact that I have been hung up on trying to solve this one problem but that I haven't had as much time to work on Killink CSV Editor as I would like.  The reason for the lack of time includes a number of factors including adjusting to life as a new father.  But the number one factor is the need to make enough income to pay the bills, keep food on the table, keep a roof over the family's head.  You know the story.  We're all basically in the same boat.  It's what responsible adults do.

Where does the time go?  After all I work for myself, right?  Yep, I do.  And as much as I love working solely on my own products each and every day, the sales number just are there...YET.  Product sales improve each year which means I get to spend more time working on my own software products.  But to help make sure bills are paid, food is on the table, etc, I must do custom software projects for other companies from time to time.  This is where a lot of my work time has been going in recent months, and until product sales improve to a point where I no longer need to do custom software work I have to balance my work time between White Peak Software products and custom software for other companies.

The good news is I'm on track to [hopeful] say bye-bye to custom software projects within the next 12 to 18 months.  When this happens I'll be able to devote more time to my products, existing ones as well as new products I have brewing in my head.

That's the longer answer.  Great!  So now what?  First starters I'm going to stop work on very large file support.  This one feature is probably needed by less than 5 percent of the current user base while other features such as Unicode support is needed by a much larger percentage of users.  With this one item off my plate I can once again return to adding new features to Killink CSV Editor in a quick, timely manner.  I cannot yet provide a time line for the next update but I can tell you progress will finally be made.

Now that I have decided to drop very large file support my next step will be to complete the re-write of Killink CSV Editor.  The re-write is needed to support Unicode and to make it easier to include new features and push out more frequent updates.  The good news is the re-write is almost complete.  It was near completion last fall when I got side tracked by the very large file support problem.  Once the re-write is done I will push out a new beta update as soon as I can.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[wayneeglonbrown posted the comment "would be good to be able to delete one put in in error" in the App Store. This is not the first time someone has asked for this feature or asked the question "how to delete."  Good news is this feature already exists. Labor Mate provides 2 ways to delete a recorded contraction.

One option is to use the swipe delete feature common to many iPhone applications. Simply slide your finger across the item and a Delete button will appear. Touch the Delete button and the contraction is removed.

The other option is to tap the contraction item. This takes you to a second screen. At the bottom of this screen is a Delete Contraction button. Touch this button to delete the individual contraction.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[stevenwt2 writes this about Labor Mate in his feedback at the App Store, "Used it throughout a night of contractions and it worked flawlessly. No crashes, no problems, and it was easy to keep track of an average. If there was anything to update about the app, I would want the 'Summary' screen to be able to average based on a time period or number of contractions (average over last 5 contractions or over last hour, etc.) as an average over the entire night can be a little misleading. However, that is looking to the next version - good luck."

Good news, stevenwt2. The average is already calculated based on the number of contractions.  In fact, the duration average shown on the summary screen is based on the last 3 contractions and the average frequency is based on the last 6 contractions.

Thanks for the great feedback and congratulations on the arrival of your new little one!!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wow, has it really been 3 months since my last blog post. I've gotta work on improving that.

Speaking of improvements, a new enhancement is finally coming to Labor Mate.  The next release will finally include a chart showing the duration and frequency of contractions over the last hour.  Here is an sample of what the chart will look like:

<a title="View ContractionChartv3 on Ember" href="http://emberapp.com/users/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv3"><img src="http://emberapp.com/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv3/sizes/m.png" alt="ContractionChartv3 hosted by Ember" /></a>

One thing to note is that intensity is not something captured by Labor Mate at the moment, so the chart will initially default the intensity level to 5.  That is 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is a not so intense contraction and 10 is the OMG, GET THIS BABY OUT OF ME contraction.  Here is the same chart with no intensity.

<a title="View ContractionChartv4 on Ember" href="http://emberapp.com/users/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv4"><img src="http://emberapp.com/kirbyt/images/contractionchartv4/sizes/m.png" alt="ContractionChartv4 hosted by Ember" /></a>

Obviously these sample screen shots are not from an iPhone or iPod touch.  I decided to prototype the chart in a Mac desktop app, which is what you see pictured here.

I hope to have the updated app submitted to Apple before the end of the month. Stay tune for more.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>360idev Denver: A Personal Review</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple of weeks ago I attended <a href="http://www.360idev.com/">360idev</a> in Denver. The conference was one of the best developer conferences I have ever attended and the best one I have attended in recent years. What made this conference so good? A number of things (in no particular order):

1) The people
2) The sessions
3) The Game Jam
4) The community (aka the people)

My conference experience started Saturday night when I met up with fellow iPhone developers from the Boston area.  Prior to leaving for Denver I knew 1 other iPhone developer in the area, but by the time I left I had 6 new friends all building and publishing iPhone apps.  Working from home for the last 5 years can get lonely so making new friends made the trip worth while even if the conference had suck, which it did not.

The conference kicked off on Sunday with a day of hands-on lab.  This was actually Day 0 of the conference since these pre-conference sessions were held the day before the official conference start.  I attended the advanced debugging and hacking the iPhone sessions. Both were amazing. I learned many new ticks in the debugging session, and I was blown away by <a href="http://www.saurik.com/">Jay Freeman</a> who hacked the Maps app.

The bar by which all other conference sessions would be judged by me had been set on that day, and the bar was set high.  Admittedly I expected the rest of the conference to not be nearly as good.  Boy was I wrong.

The next 3 days were packed with extremely helpful, useful, and insightful sessions.  The sessions covered everything from business and marketing related topics to hands-on tech talks on topics such as Core Data, Core Animation, game development, and more.  It's hard to say what was my favorite session given that all the sessions I attended were outstanding sans 2 sessions.  Those 2 sessions were still good, just not as good as the other sessions I attended.

A true highlight of the conference for me was the <a href="http://iphonegamejam.com/">Game Jam</a>.  The Game Jam was the brain child of <a href="http://gamesfromwithin.com/">@SnappyTouch</a> and it was a total hit.  The Game Jam was open to all, not just game developers.  I've never done game development before but I've been interested in game development for quite some time now.  So I attended.  I joined forces with another Boston area developer.  Our game ended up not being much, but that was fine. We had fun, and I totally enjoyed the experience.  Just watching the other developers crank out some amazing work in the late hours of the night was a real thrill for me.

The number one lesson I got out of the Game Jam is to push myself beyond my comfort zone.  I've been doing software development for more than half of my life and I've become comfortable with the type of apps I tend to write.  The Game Jam reminded me of what it was like programming 20 years ago, back when I would write code just for the hell of it, when I would write tons of small programs just to learn something new or to trying something I thought was cool, and not worry if or how I could make money off the program.  In some ways, you can say the Game Jam has re-kindled a lost spirit in me.

If I had to pick the one thing I liked the most about the conference I would have to say the sense of community.  It has been a long time since I felt like a part of a community.  This is due in part to me working from home for a number of years, but also in part to the difficulties finding a group of people who share a common interesting and passion.  In ways it reminded me how I felt in the 90s attending BorCons and discovering the Delphi community.  But this new iPhone developer community that I discovered at 360idev is different.  Like me, almost everyone I met is an indie developer or is working for a small (2 to 5) person company.  Also I was surprised, and a bit jealous, of the number of husband wife teams present at the conference.

As I said, 360idev Denver was the best developer conference I have attended in recent years.  The people, the sessions, the community all helped make it a great conference.  I'm not sure if I will be able to attend the next 360idev conference.  I'm hoping to attend NSConference in February and I'm saving money for next year's WWDC, which I definitely will be attending.  But with luck I will hopefully make it to San Jose in April.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/iPhoneJapanese1.png"></a><a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/iphone-ja.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-143" title="iphone-ja" src="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/iphone-ja.png" alt="iphone-ja" hspace="6" vspace="6" height="350" align="right" /></a>I recently went through the process of translating Labor Mate into 8 different languages.  Unfortunately the phrase "Labor Mate" doesn't translate well into other languages such as Japanese and Germany so the translators came up with new localized app names.  The problem I had though was displaying the translated app name on the iPhone's springboard.

After a bit of experimenting I finally got the translated app name to display.  Turns out the steps are fairly simple.  Here are the steps I took to localize the app name:
<ol>
	<li>Added the property LSHasLocalizedDisplayName to Info.plist and set to True (mark the checkbox). Note that Xcode might change the property name to "Application has localized display name".</li>
	<li>Add a new strings file called InfoPlist.strings.</li>
	<li>Make the file InfoPlist.strings localizable.</li>
	<li>Add the languages that will have a translated app name.</li>
	<li>For each localized version of the InfoPlist.strings file, add the follow string key/value pair: CFBundleDisplayName = "App Name";</li>
	<li>Be sure to set "App Name" to the translated value.</li>
</ol>
That's it.

<a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/InfoPlist.strings.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132" title="InfoPlist.strings" src="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/InfoPlist.strings.png" alt="InfoPlist.strings" width="532" height="443" /></a>

Speaking of language translation, I hired the fine folks over at <a href="http://iphone-i18n.com/">iphone-i18n.com</a> to translate the app description, keywords, and in-app strings for Labor Mate.  I met Chuck and Judith of iphone-i18n.com at <a href="http://www.360idev.com/">360iDev|Denver</a>.  They impressed me with their knowledge of internationalizing and localizing applications as well as their specific technical how to knowledge for the iPhone.

If you are an iPhone developer looking to <a href="http://iphone-i18n.com/">translate your iPhone application</a> into other languages then I highly recommend talking with Chuck and Judith at iphone-i18n.com.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here are some apps and services I find useful as an iPhone developer:

<a href="http://www.ideaswarm.com/products/appviz/">AppViz</a> is Mac desktop app for iPhone developers. It downloads and reports app sales from iTunes Connect, provides charts and such to see how sales are doing, and it downloads app reviews from various app stores.

<a href="http://github.com/omz/AppSales-Mobile">AppSales Mobile</a> is an open source iPhone app for downloading and reviewing sales reports from iTunes Connect.

<a href="http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/">AppDailySales</a> is a python script that downloads daily sales reports from iTunes Connect. I use the script in a cron job on a server to make sure I have a copy of each daily sales report even on days when I'm traveling and might not have an Internet connection.

<a href="http://majicjungle.com/majicrank.html">MajicRank</a> is an addicting Mac desktop app for viewing app ranking in each app store. I say it's addicting because it's fun watching my app move up and down the rankings list, and I end up checking the rankings multiple times throughout the day.

<a href="http://www.iphoneappquotes.com/">iPhoneAppQuotes.com</a> is a lead service I recently used to find additional iPhone contract work. The service only provides the leads.  It's still up to you, the iPhone developer, to reach out to the potential client, sell your services, and close the deal. I will definitely use this service again if/when I start looking for more iPhone contract work.

<a href="http://iphone-i18n.com/">iPhone Internationalization</a> provides localization services for iPhone developers. Recently they helped with translating Labor Mate into 8 additional languages, provided outstanding service, and fast turn around time on the text translations.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm making an early 2010 New Year's Resolution. I'm going to blog more. There. I've said it. And in a blog posting no less. This entry will haunt me if I do not stick to this resolution.

I've done a horrible job at blogging since my son was born 20 months ago. This is true for all 3 of my main blog site, my <a href="http://www.thecave.com/">personal blog</a>, this <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/">company/tech blog</a>, and even the <a href="http://RowanTurner.net">blog about my son</a>. Of course it's not his fault. I blame Twitter.

I've developed a bad habit. If I can't share it in 140 characters than I don't share it. This is wrong on so many levels, especially since 2009 has been such an important year for White Peak Software, which I will explain in an upcoming blog.

So with that, you can expect more postings on this blog.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been working feverishly over the last few weeks to finish version 1.0 of a client's new iPhone app. But it seems like I'll never be finished. There just so much more we want to add to the app. This is true for most, if not all, software releases. "If I just had another day then I can add this really neat feature." That one day becomes two days which becomes three days and so on.

One thing to consider with an iPhone app is the review period. The review period is about two weeks for most app. If you are like me then you will think, "Two weeks for review? Then I better spend another few days on the app before submitting." But my opinion on this is changing.

Apps can be rejected from the App Store for all sorts of reasons. A misuse of an icon. Use of a private API call. Crashes on start up. The list goes on. Even though you may spend a few more days on the app to get that one additional feature in, you don't know for sure if the app will be accepted or rejected.

My client app has some interesting and unique features that involve having voice and data connections at the same time (I'll share more about this later). Given its uniqueness there's a good chance the app will be rejected initially and an even better chance the review process will be longer than the average 14 days. So I've decided it's time to submit the app even though the app isn't as complete as I would like.

Yes, there are more features planned for the app and there is a known (minor) bug or two, but we don't plan to "go live" with the app for another couple of months. Submitting now, however, will help eliminate  surprises down the road.

My way of thinking about the app review process is changing. I'm starting to think a better approach is to submit early and mark the availability date for the app to some date way into the future.  This will give you an idea of what to expect from Apple and the review process earlier in the development process. And you can always submit an update or two before the future availability date.

Of course you want to make sure the early submitted app is usable and stable, and that core functionality is present, but I see know reason for waiting until you have a completed version 1.0 app to submit to Apple. Submitting early should be a part of the development lifecycle process.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/LaborMate-reMovem.PNG"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 6px;" title="LaborMate-reMovem" src="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/LaborMate-reMovem.PNG" alt="LaborMate-reMovem" hspace="6" vspace="12" width="40%" align="left" /></a>To say <a href="http://twitter.com/mmartel">Matt Martel</a> is a swell guy is an understatement. He is a super swell guy who does what he can to contribute to the iPhone development community, and he is somewhat a role model for me (though I doubt he knows it...yet). He started and ran a regular iPhone developer meet up group in the Boston metro area, he is willing to share his thoughts and feedback on the business of running an indie shop, and just this week he made a special offer to indie iPhone developers.

I first met Matt, and his wife Trish, in September at <a href="http://www.360idev.com/">360iDev</a> Denver. Turns out Matt and Trish lived in the Boston area too.  I say "lived" because they recently moved to Colorado Springs, but that's a different story.

Matt and Trish have an indie software company called <a href="http://mundue.net/">Mundue</a>, and have published a few casual games for the iPhone and iPod touch. The most popular is <a href="http://removem.mundue.net/removem/Home.html">reMovem</a>, which I find to be highly addictive. Two favors of reMovem are available, a freeware ad-support version and a $1.99 paid version. The paid version comes with additional play modes which make it well worth the price.

A few days ago Matt made an <a href="http://twitter.com/mmartel/status/6897058289">offer to the indie iPhone development community</a> that was too generous for me to pass up. He offered to include ads for apps  in his popular game reMovem, the free edition. I was a little hesitant at first because I have not tried advertising Labor Mate this way before. Past experience with Google Adwords for Killink CSV Editor has turned me off of ad placement to market my products. However, I'm learning this week that might be a mistake.

In the first 24 hours the Labor Mate ad received 112 clickthroughs, and 238 total clickthroughs within the first 48 hours. Admittedly I was surprised by these numbers. First, Labor Mate is very niched app, and second, I thought "Who wants to learn more about a contraction timer while playing a game?" Boy was I wrong. 238 people found out about Labor Mate in a 48 hour time period that probably would have never known about the app. I find this to be great.

Unfortunately it's hard for me to say if the ad has resulted in additional sells. According to Matt, "Most ads are getting an average of 1% clickthrough (CTR) which means 50-150 clicks per day. That's really not much, and with conversion (sales) rates of 5% you might not notice any difference." This is true. I haven't noticed any change in the normal sales pattern for Labor Mate over the last couple of days. Still, I'm happy to know at least 238 additional people have learned about Labor Mate.

Thank you very much Matt for your generous offer to the indie iPhone development community. This little experiment has been a huge eye opener for me. Thanks for the opportunity to participate.

Now everyone go buy <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/removem/id287976599?mt=8">reMovem</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>White Peak Software Year in Review 2009</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those who might be new to this blog, my name is Kirby Turner. I run White Peak Software, my independent software company, and have done so since November 2003. That makes White Peak Software slightly over 6 years old now.

There have been ups and downs for White Peak Software over the years but 2009 seems like the most challenging for me. For starters I have transited the company from one that offers services (aka contract programming) focused on Microsoft technologies to an iPhone company. This is a major step in my ultimate goal of eliminating service work all together so I can focus on writing and selling my own software products.

There is only a day and a half remaining in 2009. Even so, I thought now is a good time to post a year in review for 2009. My primary inspiration for this posting comes from <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/12/18/bingo-card-creator-year-in-review-2009/">Patrick McKenzie</a> of Bingo Card Creator frame. While I make a good living from contract programming, it is not the ultimate goal for my company so I will focus the business stats reported below on the product side of the business only. Besides, the product side is likely more interesting to other indie developers out there.

<strong>Business Stats for the Year</strong>

Product Revenue: $15,217.57 (reflects payments received in 2009 for product sales between December 2008 and November 2009)

(Sales numbers below reflect sales between January 2009 and December 2009. For those doing the math, the sales numbers below will not add up to the product revenue total reported above.)

SMTP Diagnostics Sales: $737.10 (change from last year -24%)

Killink CSV Editor Sales: $9,089.20 (change from last year 6%)

Labor Mate Sales: $4,104.10 (change from last year 1,515%; U.S. sales only; includes sales between January 2009 and November 2009)

<strong>Web Stats for the Year</strong>

Visit: 19,943

Unique Visitors: 17,293

Pageviews: 41,381

Traffic sources: 25.55% Direct Traffic, 25.55% Referring Sites, 48.87% Search Engines (with 44.60% coming from Google)

Trial software downloads: Unfortunately I just discovered that my tracking of downloads broke at the end of April so I don't have the stats. Bad me for not being on top of this.

<strong>What Went Right</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Marketing efforts this summer for Labor Mate helped increase sales.</li>
	<li>Labor Mate remained in the 100 in the Health and Fitness category for most of the year, reaching an all time high ranking of 34.</li>
	<li>A mention in MacBreak Weekly podcast caused a one week boost in sales.</li>
	<li>Got my first taste of in-app advertising thanks to Matt Martel.</li>
	<li>Sales for Killink CSV Editor continued to grow despite not releasing a single update the entire year.</li>
	<li>I reduced my technology focus on the service side of the business from a broad range related to Microsoft to a smaller set of technologies with a primary focus on the iPhone.  I spent half the year doing full time iPhone development, which has been great. Unfortunately this transition involved ending relationships, some long term, with clients not interested in iPhone development, but it also meant building new relationships.</li>
</ul>
<strong>What Didn't Go So Well</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Failed to release Killink CSV Editor version 2. I'm hugely disappointed by this. I had a number of setbacks at the end of 2008/beginning of 2009 that derailed Killink CSV Editor. I'll spare you from the list of excuses. At the end of the day I screwed up.</li>
	<li>Failed to release my second iPhone app. Another setback for 2009 that effects my ultimate plans for the company.</li>
	<li>I had a serious time management issue for most of 2009. Life with a kid has introduced new challenges for me. For almost half of 2009 I juggled my time between taking care of the kid and working on White Peak Software. The kid won most of my time, leaving little time for the company. This time management problem meant I spent what little time I did have on the service side of the business, ignoring the product side.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Plans for 2010</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Spend more time focusing on my products. The kid starts daycare next week which will should help out on the time management, although it does mean another expense to pay out.</li>
	<li>Release Killink CSV Editor version 2. This is long over due.</li>
	<li>Release Labor Mate 2. This will be the app I originally dreamed of but never implemented.</li>
	<li>Release at least 2 other iPhone apps. Details coming on the new apps.</li>
	<li>Eliminate service work entirely by the end of 2010. This means I will be able to focus 100% of my "work" time to my products.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On January 1, 2010, the official support groups for all White Peak Software products will moving to Google Groups. The new URLs are below:

Labor Mate
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/whitepeaksoftware-labormate">http://groups.google.com/group/whitepeaksoftware-labormate</a>

Killink CSV Editor
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/whitepeaksoftware-killinkcsveditor">http://groups.google.com/group/whitepeaksoftware-killinkcsveditor</a>

Why the move? The old forum software I used was becoming a pain to host and keep running. Also, almost all support questions and bug reports I receive come via email and not via the support forum. In other words, the this support forum was rarely used. And frankly I do not like web forums. I prefer email. 

Google Groups offers the best of both, web forums for those who prefer it and email for those who rather interact with a community via email. I know the move will be a pain for the select few who use this forum especially if don't already have a Google Account. But the small pain outweighs the benefits of the move.

Also, I hope this move will help the online community to grow. Time will tell if that happens or not.

No support group URL for SMTP Diagnostics? Support for SMTP Diagnostics will be email only going forward. Use the <a href="http://whitepeaksoftware.com/main/default/contact">contact us</a> page to send your questions and bug reports.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the hardest challenges I face right now is growing my independent software business while taking care of my 21 month son. Like many other dads out there, my wife works. But what is not typical is my wife is a flight attendant. When she works she is gone for 3, sometimes 4 days in a row, leaving me to fly solo with the kid.

Over the last 21 months we have tried a number of things to help me find time to work on and for White Peak Software. Some attempts have been more successful than others, but in the end I still struggle to find quality work time. 

<h2>Taking care of the kid myself and work while he sleeps.</h2>

This was a disaster. Taking care of a kid all day is exhausting, and with the wife away I not only had to use the time when the kid was sleeping to catch up on my own sleep, but I needed to clean up around the house, cook myself lunch and dinner, and so on. This meant I didn't start work until 10 pm or so on most days. And this was at the time when the kid was waking during the night. I was doing good if I got 3 hours of work and 3 hours of sleep in a day.

<h2>Daytime babysitters to the rescue.</h2>

I definitely needed help so we tried babysitters. This past summer we had 2 sitters that were awesome. Best of all the kid really liked both of them. The sitters would watch the kid for approximately 6 hours a day. This definitely helped. I used that time to shower, eat breakfast and lunch, and work. Unfortunately it still left me with only about 4 hours of quality work time per day. I could have logged more hours by working nights but honestly after months of going solo with the kid while the wife was away I needed the sleep. So I stopped working as much at night and used the time to catch up on sleep and re-energize.

<h2>All good things come to an end.</h2>

The two sitters we had during the summer were awesome, as I already said. They set the bar for how to judge all other sitters, and the bar was set high. Unfortunately for us, but good for them, each sitter got "real" jobs. The babysitting thing was only during college years and not a career choice. 

One thing that helped with these babysitters is that we used a set schedule for each week.  One sitter was always here on Tuesday and Thursday and the other was here Monday and Wednesday, and sometimes Friday. The set schedule made it more predicable for me regarding when I could work. The problem was my wife's work schedule isn't predicable, so this meant there were times we paid for a babysitter even though we didn't need her. When my wife isn't working a trip, she is more than happy to spend the day with the kid.

This lead us to try using babysitters on a flexible schedule. We might need a sitter on Monday and Tuesday of one week, and Wednesday Thursday of the following. This was problematic because even babysitters like to have some structure in their work life. 

Finding sitters who could be flexible was challenging, and there was even a period of time when we didn't have a sitter at all. I was once again watching the kid all day and trying to squeeze in as much work as possible at night. It was very exhausting.

<h2>What's next? Daycare.</h2>

Since the flexible babysitting thing didn't work out, and since we don't need to have a babysitter at the house all the time, we have decided to give daycare a try. Daycare provides the benefit of having set days when the kid will be in daycare (we're doing part time, 3 days a week for now). This means once again my work time is predicable again. And if we decide not to put him in for a day, it's doesn't cost us as much. The daily cost for daycare is about half what we pay for a babysitter. So on days when we don't need someone else looking after the kid it will not cost us as much as it did when we used a babysitter.

We still may use a babysitter during the day from time to time, and lucky for me, the daycare will allow us to switch around the 3 days from time to time. So I'm hopeful this next attempt at finding me time to work will be good for both me and my wife. Time will tell. The kid starts daycare tomorrow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Labor Mate was originally release in October 2008. My expectations for it were low. If it sold 100 units in the first year then I would consider it a success.  But my expectation were exceeded.  Labor Mate sold 4997 units in the first year, and it has sold 9201 units in all as of yesterday.

In January 2009 Labor Mate broke into the Top 100 for the Health and Fitness category in the U.S. store. It stayed in the Top 100 daily for nearly 11 straight months peaking at <a href="http://emberapp.com/kirbyt/images/labormate-rank34-us">number 34</a> in the U.S. store. Labor Mate has also been in the Top 100 for the Health and Fitness category in a number of other stores including the U.K., Japan, Sweden, Netherlands, and Italy among others. All of this changed in mid-November. Labor Mate's fall from grace had started.

A couple of things happened in November bumping Labor Mate out of the Top 100 in its category. First, it received a couple of ridiculous, negative comments in iTunes.  I'm not sure of the real impact but the slide from the Top 100 started at the time of the comments. Second and only a day or two later, <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=joxFicmfXq8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fbabybump-pregnancy-app%252Fid332366275%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D6%2526partnerId%253D30">BabyBump</a> made the What's Hot list.  I believe it is this second point that has taken the biggest toll on Labor Mate's Top 100 streak.

BabyBump was released in October 2009, just over a year since the initial release of Labor Mate.  BabyBump includes features that I have long planned for Labor Mate but have yet to implement.  And honestly it looks better than Labor Mate in my opinion.  Creative design has always been a weak skill set of mine.

At the end of the day, BabyBump did it better.  This was a major wakeup call for me.  I let Labor Mate, the one time market leader in its space, grow stale. I had a top ranking and it was mine to lose.  And lose it I did.

A major mistake I made in 2009 was to focus most of my attention on contract work and not enough time on my own company. This lack of focus was a setback but also a major kick in my ass.  Unfortunately it took Labor Mate's fall from grace to light the fire under me (and in me).  I have learned from this lesson and will do better going forward. For starters, I have since hired a part-time designer as the "Creative Director" for White Peak Software and the first project we worked on together looks great.  It will be in the app store soon.

So what about Labor Mate? Is Labor Mate dead?  No, far from it.  Just a few weeks before the fall from grace, version 1.5 of Labor Mate was approved.  This release added support for 8 additional languages, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Swedish, and Russian. So while sales in the U.S. have dropped, sales worldwide have improved and Labor Mate continues to sell an average of 31 units per day worldwide. So despite not being in the Top 100 of the Health and Fitness category in the U.S., sales remain steady.  Also, I have big plans for Labor Mate 2, which I will start working on soon.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday I was having a very good day but around 5:45 pm my day got even better. I received an email from the fine folks at 360iDev that my topic "Building Web Service Powered iPhone Apps" has been selected. Yep, that's right folks. I will be speaking at the upcoming <a href="http://www.360idev.com/">360iDev San Jose</a> (April 11-14).

I'm very excited about this opportunity for a number of reasons. First and foremost, speaking at the conference gives me a chance to share what I have learned over the recents months about leveraging web services within iPhone applications.  I have worked with web services in some form for over a decade now so it's only natural that I would gravitate towards using them in iPhone applications.  I also plan to blog more on the topic as I prepare my materials for the conference.

Another reason I'm excited about speaking at 360iDev this spring is I get to attend the conference. I was on the fence about going. I'm already registered for <a href="http://nsconference.com/">NSConference 2010 USA</a> and I plan to attend this year's WWDC. I actually was planning to email John at 360iDev to ask if there are plans for another event later in the year.  360iDev Denver was such an incredible experience I knew I didn't want to go the entire year without attending at least one event. But before I got the chance to ask about another event this year I received the email accepting me as a speaker. This of course made my decision easy. Heck yeah I'm going in April!

And the final reason I'm excited about this opportunity, 360iDev events are the best. Granted I have attended only 1 and that was last fall, but it was by far the best developer conference I have attended in recent years. And definitely one of the top conferences I have ever attended. I posted <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2009/10/13/360idev-denver-a-personal-review/">my comments about 360iDev Denver</a> back in October so I will not repeat myself here. What I will say, though, is if you are an iPhone developer then you should attend 360iDev San Jose. I guarantee you will pick up a trick or two or twelve and best of all you will get to meet other awesome iPhone developers.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last few months I have been inspired by different iPhone developer community events including <a href="http://www.360idev.com/">360iDev</a> and <a href="http://drinksontap.org/">DrinksOnTap</a>. So much so I have decided to start my own monthly <a href="http://nsiphonedevs.org">event for Boston area iPhone developers</a>.

The opportunity to meet fellow iPhone developers and form new friendships is very exciting to me and it motivates me to do more with White Peak Software. Working from home is a wonderful perk of being an indie developer but it can be lonely at times. Meetup events, conferences, and so on are great ways for me to feel connected. And it gives my wife a needed break from my geek talk, which she doesn't always understand but always happily smiles and acts like she is interested.

The Boston area has a number of meetup events but it is not always possible for me to get into Boston. And let's face it. <a href="http://mbta.com/">MBTA</a> ain't the <a href="http://mta.info/">MTA</a>. I missed the 10:40 pm train to Salem at the last event I attended in Cambridge. This meant waiting until the 12:10 am train. I finally got home at 1 am. 

So what's a North Shore iPhone developer who can't always make it into Boston to do? Start a monthly gathering in the North Shore of course.

Over the New Year's weekend I <a href="http://twitter.com/kirbyt/status/7305792560">tweeted</a> about a new group I'm creating called <a href="http://nsiphonedevs.org/">NSiPhoneDevs</a>. The NS prefix is a fun play on the prefix for many of the foundation classes from Apple, but the NS prefix also stands for "North Shore". The North Shore iPhone Developers or NSiPhoneDevs for short.

I'm still working out the details including the exact location. What I do know is the events will be held in downtown Salem, the events will be monthly, and the first event will be this spring. Stay tune for more NSiPhoneDevs news from the official website (<a href="http://nsiphonedevs.org/">http://nsiphonedevs.org/</a>) or follow <a href="http://twitter.com/nsiphonedevs">@NSiPhoneDevs</a> on Twitter.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[User feedback in iTunes for Labor Mate is typically good. Most user rate Labor Mate with 4 and 5 stars. But every now and then a bad review comes in. A bad review is expected from time to time. After all the app isn't for everyone.  Still, there are times when I'm confused by user feedback. Take for example this feedback from Whidbey Island Filkin-in-Law:

<cite>"This works great for false labor; I used it every night for a week - sometimes for three hours at a time and I thought it would be neat to mail the info to our midwife. However, when my labor actually started and my water broke two days ago, I thought of this AP and how it would be the last thing I'd do @ 3 min apart & how my review might say: if you're using this, it is false labor..."</cite>

I admit I would not expect my wife to use Labor Mate while she is having contractions. That's why I tell people Labor Mate is typically used by the expecting mom's birthing partner, be it her husband, boyfriend, life partner, a friend, and so on. A mom-to-be has too much going on to worry about timing contractions. Let someone else do it. (Though there is nothing wrong with a single mom timing her own contractions. Everyone's experience is different.)

So while I agree with Whidbey Island Filkin-in-Law that the last thing a woman would want to do when contractions are 3 minutes apart is to touch a start and stop button on an iPhone, I don't understand the 1-star rating. Whidbey Island Filkin-in-Law used the app every night for a week up to 3 hours at a time. She obviously found value in the app and yet she rated it with a single star.

Reviews like this one aways leave me scratching my head and wondering.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been a <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/">FogBugz</a> user for <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2005/02/28/fogbugz.aspx">nearly 5 years</a>. To say I rely on FogBugz is an understatement. It is a critical component in my software development process allowing me to track bugs, feature requests, communicate with customers and more across multiple client and internal projects. To date I have logged over 22,000 cases in FogBugz, which I feel is a lot for a solo developer. And yet, if I had a better, more efficient way to create new cases I might have many more in FogBugz today.

The inefficiency of creating new cases in FogBugz comes from the fact that FogBugz is a web-based application meaning you need a web browser. Web-base apps are not always the most efficient way to do something and FogBugz is no exception despite having a really nice web UI. Entering a batch of new cases is slow and having to launch a web browser, go to a web site, etc just to enter a new case is not the quickest process. What is needed is a desktop application that allows me to quickly create new cases in FogBugz. Lucky for me and other power FogBugz users out there, <a href="http://manicwave.com/">Manicwave</a> has a solution.

Last week Manicwave released it's first version of a new <a href="http://manicwave.com/products/tickets">FogBugz desktop client for the Mac</a> called <a href="http://manicwave.com/products/tickets">Tickets</a>. Tickets is by far the easiest, fastest way to create new FogBugz cases. 

I had the fortunate opportunity to beta test Tickets prior to the official release. I was hooked within a couple of minutes. The rate at which I can create new cases is simply amazing. Before I started using Tickets there were times I would not create a case. Say for example I'm deep in code and I encounter a bug. Sometimes it was just too much trouble to launch a web browser, go to the FogBugz web site, click New Case, select the project, area, etc, and enter the bug information. Since I rely on FogBugz to track all my work, especially client-specific work, not logging a task or bug was a big no no for me. But I admit there were times when I didn't create a new case just to save a minute or two. Tickets changes this. 

With Tickets I'm only a shortcut keystroke away from creating a new case. Now when I encounter a bug, think of a new feature, or just need to log a task I type the global shortcut key combination and Tickets instantly gives me a new case window. Say I encounter a bug or need to log a task while in Xcode. I type the shortcut key and bam! Tickets displays a new case window for me. The time it takes me to create a new case is only slightly longer than adding a <em>// TODO:</em> to the source code itself. No more of this launch the web browser, go to the web site, etc, etc, etc.

Tickets allows you to rapidly create new cases with attachments. Just drag and drop the files you want to attach. Tickets even includes it own screenshot feature allowing you to capture the full screen, capture a window, capture an area, or capture a timed screenshot.

Tickets is the most efficient way to create new FogBugz cases on the Mac desktop. If you regularly use FogBugz you owe it to yourself to try Tickets.

<em>Disclosure: I was not paid nor asked to post this review. I did beta test Tickets prior to the public release and I did receive a complimentary license for my feedback and participation in the beta program.

I'm looking for parents who use day care services to answer this <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/857YTSY">short survey</a>.

In a nutshell, the app idea is a daycare cost calculator. The app will help parents calculate daycare costs and is ideal for parents who pay different amounts each month.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The final sales numbers are in for White Peak Software. $150 was raised by our customers as part of <a href="http://www.indierelief.com/">Indie+Relief</a>. A big THANKS to all who participated.

Because it is such a good cause I decided to do something a little different. The original plan was to donate all proceeds from the sales on January 20. However, additional processing fees are taken out of each transaction - 30% to Apple and 15% to eSellerate. I decided I will donate the cost of the transaction fees myself. 

Here is a breakdown of sales for the donation:

<table width="85%">
<tr><th>Product</th><th>Units Sold</th><th>Unit Cost</th><th>Total</th></tr>
<tr><td>Labor Mate</td><td align="right">42</td><td align="right">$0.99</td><td align="right">$41.58</td></tr>
<tr><td>Killink CSV Editor</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">$27.00</td><td align="right">$81.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>SMTP Diagnostics</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">$11.95</td><td align="right">$23.90</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Grand Total</strong></td><td align="right">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">&nbsp;</td><td align="right"><strong>$146.48</strong></td></tr>
</table>

I rounded the grand total up to <strong>$150</strong>. The money has been donated to <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> as part of the emergency relief for Haiti.

Finally, I want to send a big THANKS for <a href="http://twitter.com/justin">Justin Williams</a> of <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/">Second Gear Software</a> for coming up with the idea and <a href="http://twitter.com/garrettmurray">Garrett Murray</a> who built the Indie+Relief web site. Both individuals put a great deal of time and effort to make this event happen in just a matter of days.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://twitter.com/rsachdeva">@rsachdeva</a> asked, "How do you know when someone buys the app?" Of course, he is referring to an iPhone. Here is a list of tools I use to reviewing my daily iPhone sales figures:

<a href="http://www.ideaswarm.com/products/appviz/">AppViz</a>: AppViz is a brilliant piece of Mac software that allows iPhone developers to download and review their app sales. It also supports ranking and review downloads. AppViz sells for $29.95 (USD) and is well worth the price in my opinion.

<a href="http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/">AppDailySales</a>: This is a python script that downloads daily sales reports. It's open source and written by yours truly. I have the script setup to run daily on a server. This ensures I never miss a daily report even when I'm away from the computer for a few days.

<a href="http://github.com/omz/AppSales-Mobile">AppSales Mobile</a>: An open source iPhone application that is great for looking at daily sales when on the road.

		<title>Switching the Xcode Path using xcode-select</title>
		<link>http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/02/02/switching-the-xcode-path-using-xcode-select/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I currently have two versions of Xcode installed on my primary development machine. One version is the official release from Apple and the other version is a beta version. I install the latest release in the default directory /Developer and I install beta releases in a parallel directory, /Developer-n.n.n where "n.n.n" is the Xcode version number.

I also have a number of different distribution certificates for making adhoc and distribution builds for my iPhone apps and client apps. I use different keychains to manage the multiple certificates. Because of this I rely on bash scripts to make adhoc and distribution builds of the different iPhone apps that I am responsible for.

The latest Xcode beta release does not include iPhone OS SDK 2.2.1. Not really a big deal for me since the SDK is included in Xcode 3.2.1. However, to my surprise when I ran a script for a 2.2.1 app the build failed to find the 2.2.1 SDK.  Turns out installing the latest beta release replaces the <em>/usr/bin/xcodebuild</em> command. Oh know! My build script no longer works for 2.2.1 apps.

Thanks to a tip from <a href="http://twitter.com/joar_at_work">@joar_at_work</a> on Twitter I was able to solve the problem. The magical command I needed was <em>/usr/bin/xcode-select</em>. This command allows you to change the Xcode directory used by xcodebuild. For instance, in my situation xcodebuild was looking at /Developer-3.2.2 which does not include iPhone OS SDK 2.2.1. By using xcode-select I was able to point xcodebuild to the /Developer directory.

Switching directories is simple with xcode-select. Just use the -switch option. For example: <strong>xcode-select -switch /Developer</strong>. This did the trick for me and my build scripts were once again working with the correct Xcode environment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm trying a little experiment. I want to see if I can encourage individuals who might be looking for a cracked version of Killink CSV Editor to buy a license at a discounted price. As part of this experiment I also want to see if I can get the top ranking on search results that include some combination of the following phrases: Killink CSV Editor, serial numbers, registration codes, registration keys, key generators, crack, warez, free, password, patches, pirate key, keymaker, and keygen.

I have a deal for you if you are one of those individuals looking for a cracked version of Killink CSV Editor. These are tough times and we all want to save a few dollars where we can. So my deal for you is this. Instead of downloading one of the cracked versions of Killink CSV Editor, which by the way comes from an untrusted source so BEWARE, I'll give you 20% off the current price for a single user license. Just use the code UNCRACKME when placing your order. No strings attached. No passing of judgement. Just my way of helping you save a few dollars while at the same time encouraging the use a trusted version of Killink CSV Editor.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today is the official start of what I am calling iPhone Mac Conference Tour 2010. Between now and June I will be attending 3 iPhone and Mac developer conferences. My tour beings with <a href="http://nsconference.com/">NSConference</a>, which starts tomorrow, followed by <a href="http://www.360idev.com/">360iDev San Jose</a> in April and wraps up in June with my first visit to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a>.

<a href="http://nsconference.com/">NSConference</a> USA kicks off tomorrow with an iPhone developer workshop followed by 2 days of Mac developer talks and ending Wednesday with 2 additional workshops, one on concurrent programming and the other on insights from <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/">Matt "Legend" Gemmell</a>. I'm excited about NSConference, not only for the talks but the chance to finally meet a number of people I follow on Twitter. Plus the conference will likely be the kick in the butt I need to get started on my first commercial Mac desktop app.

<a href="http://www.360idev.com/">360iDev San Jose</a> is April 11 through 14. What can I say about 360iDev that I haven't <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2009/10/13/360idev-denver-a-personal-review/">already said</a>. It's a great conference. The last one in Denver was one of the best developer conferences I have ever attended. 360iDev San Jose will be a bit different for me though since I will be one of the speakers.  My topic will be on using web services with your iPhone apps. Oh, and if you are planning to attend be sure to <a href="http://bit.ly/8UmMI5">register here</a>. You're registration will help me win suite at the hotel.

And what better way to conclude the iPhone Mac Conference Tour 2010 then by attending Apple's own Worldwide Developer Conference (<a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a>). I've never been. This will be my first WWDC. I really wanted to go last year but had a scheduling conflict. Not this year. I have blocked off the entire month of June until the WWDC dates are announced.

So that's my conference tour for this year. I'm really looking forward to each conference. Speaking of, time to head down to the hotel lobby and meet some folks here for #nsconf.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week I attended <a href="http://nsconference.com/">NSConference</a> USA which was the conference's first visit to the States. I had an awesome time and I will definitely return to NSConference next year. Heck, I might even attend both the USA and UK events. 

The sense of community combined with the unique structure of the conference made for a wonderful time. NSConference is different from other developer related conferences in that there are not multiple tracks during the day. Instead all the attendees, called delegates at NSConference, sit in the same room and listen to the same talks. The other difference is the 30 minute break between sessions. This combination makes for a great conference going experience.

Why does the combination work so well? As a delegate I didn't have to run from room to room to hear different talks and to find a new seat. I'm able to leave my gear in one spot for the entire day, and because I don't have to run room to room I can spend more time meeting and talking with other delegates. This is were the 30 minute breaks really help out. 

At other conferences my chats between sessions are never long enough to really get to know other developers. The 30 minute breaks at NSConference gives you plenty of time to chat with folks you already know and to meet new ones. And because of this I actually met more people at NSConference then I have at the last 3 conferences I have attended.

And meeting other iPhone and Mac developers has never been so easy. I arrived in Atlanta late Saturday afternoon not knowing a single person. Within an hour and a half I was talking with other delegates, having beers, and sharing stories. I feel like I met close to 90 percent of all the delegates by the end of the conference, and I definitely formed new friendships with a good number of those that I met. As someone who works from home, making these connections and feeling apart of a community is very important to me. And this aspect alone makes attending NSConference worth well.

I haven't said much about the session talks yet. And yes, the talks were great. I found every topic useful and informative. The speakers really know their stuff and I learned tons. If you are seeking knowledge in Mac and iPhone development than there is no better independent developer conference. But more important to me were the connections I made with others in the iPhone and Mac development community. And this includes getting to know the speakers as well.

There are many more good things I can say about NSConference. For instance, the party Monday night was a blast. Eating at the Silver Skillet each morning was a great way to start the day. Dinner and drinks each night with the delegates was so much fun. The only negative part of the conference for me were the lunches, though many folks told me the lunches were better than those offered at WWDC. 

Lunches aside, <a href="http://nsconference.com/">NSConference</a> is a must attend conference for all iPhone and Mac developers.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/HeyPeanut-alpha01.png" alt="HeyPeanut-alpha01.png" border="0" width="35%" align="left" vspace="6" hspace="6" />I have spent the last couple of months working on a new app for the iPhone called Hey Peanut. Hey Peanut is a photo browser app with a twist for toddlers.

A while back my wife took pictures of family members and put them into a small photo album. Our son doesn't see his extended family as much as we would like so from time to time we sit with him and browse the family photo album. This gives him a chance to learn the faces of his grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. One day I was watching my wife and son browse the photo album and I thought, "There should be an app for that." Thus the idea for Hey Peanut was born.

Hey Peanut is based on the family photo album but, as I said before, with a twist. The twist is the recorded voice message. Using an iPhone and Hey Peanut a parent takes a picture of a family member then records a voice message from the family member. For instance, I can use Hey Peanut to take a picture of my mother and record a personal message from her like, "Hi Rowan! It's GranMom. I love you." My son can then browse the pictures and listen to the messages at any time.

Hey Peanut is a bit more than just a photo browser. It includes colorful "photo mats" with various sounds effects to keep the toddle engaged. Originally I was thinking of making Hey Peanut more game-like but decided it was not necessary.

Development on Hey Peanut is nearing completion. A lot of time has been spent on making a photo browser slash library manager for the parents. This mimics the photo app to some degree. I had hope to use Three20's photo viewer for this but I ran into problems so I had to write my own. Over the last few weeks I have taken my code and created a new open source photo browser project called <a href="http://github.com/kirbyt/KTPhotoBrowser">KTPhotoBrowser</a>. The latest code is available on <a href="http://github.com/kirbyt/KTPhotoBrowser">GitHub</a>. The open source project is still work in progress but it is useable. I plan to complete KTPhotoBrowser once Hey Peanut is released.

Meanwhile, if you are a parent with a little one between the ages of 1 and 3 and you think he or she would like to play with Hey Peanut then <a href="http://whitepeaksoftware.com/main/default/contact">send me a message</a> and join the beta testing team.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm very excited to announce the immediate availability of Hey Peanut in the App Store.  Hey Peanut is a new type of photo browser on the iPhone and iPod touch designed specifically for your toddler, ages 1 to 3 years old.  Hey Peanut is kid tested and parent approve.  It includes fun farm animals and sound effects to entertain your little one, but the best feature is the built-in voice recorder.

Add photos of family and friends then have them record a voice message for your child.  When you child touches the photo the voice recording will play.  This is a great way for your child to see and hear love ones who might live or be out of town.

My son Rowan, at the age of 20 months, helped me design Hey Peanut. He played with Hey Peanut at every stage.  He hated it in the beginning, always saying "No, no!"  But once all the pieces were in place, the music, farm scenes, and sound effects, he loved it. He now plays with Hey Peanut often and especially enjoys seeing and hearing his mom when she is out of town working.

If you have love ones who live out of town, or a parent that travels often, then you toddler is going to love Hey Peanut.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The iPad release day is less than 2 weeks away and like many iPhone developers I'm scurrying along to get my first iPad app submitted before the deadline. The introduction of the iPad as a new target platform means developers can choose to target the iPhone only, target just the iPad, or target both within a single application.  The last option is called a universal binary and is recommended by Apple.

The user benefits with the universal option in that the same application can run on each iPhone OS device.  In other words, the same app will run on a user's iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.  Best of all the user only pays for the app once even if the app is used on multiple devices.

I'm a fan of universal.  It makes the buying decision easier for the user.  Buy the app and it will run on all your iPhone OS devices, the ones you own today and the ones you might buy tomorrow.  The user doesn't have to think, "I have an iPhone but I might buy an iPad soon.  Should I buy the iPhone only version or the version that will run on both?"

The universal also makes it easier for the developer with regards to app naming and marketing.  With a universal app the developer has only one app, which means only one app name and one app icon.  The alternative is to release multiple editions for the app, each with its own unique name such as "App XYZ", "App XYZ for iPad", "App XYZ Universal", and so on.  

Marketing with a universal app is easier too because the developer is marketing a single edition of the application.  The developer doesn't need multiple app descriptions or web pages for each app edition.  But the universal option is not without its problems.

First, what happens if the developer already has an iPhone app in the App Store.  Can a new build of a universal binary be submitted as an app update?  Can it be submitted as an update before the deadline for launch day?  If not then that means a new app must be created which means having different app names.  And of course existing ratings and iTunes comments will not appear for the newly created app.

Another issue comes to mind.  To the developer, a universal app might feel like writing two separate apps wrapped into a single binary.  The user experience, the views, navigation, artwork, etc will likely be different for the app when run on the iPad versus the iPhone.  This complicates the code base for the developer, which increases the chances for bugs.  The developer can overcome this by separating logic in the code and performing additional testing, but this increases the development cost for the application, which leads me to pricing.  Higher development cost can lead to higher pricing.

Pricing is a big issue for me.  Will users pay more for an app on the iPad, especially if the iPad version has more features, features not feasible on the iPhone?  I think so.  But will the user who only owns an iPhone with no plans to buy an iPad pay more?  I think it's less likely.

A desktop app typically costs more than an iPhone app, and since the iPad is closer to the desktop than the iPhone in terms of its ability, especially for productivity apps, it makes sense to me that an iPad app will cost more than it's iPhone equivalent.  Will the higher price for a universal app mean the developer will likely loss out on app sales from iPhone and iPod touch users?  Or will there be another race to the bottom (i.e., 99 cents) in terms of pricing for universal iPad apps? I certainly hope not.

A developer can get around this by releasing 2 editions of the same app, one for the iPhone only at lower price point and a second universal app at a higher price point.  But now we're back to complicating the buying decision for the user with different editions of the same app.  The user is back to thinking, "Which edition do I need?  Which one should I buy?"

I already asked will iPad app pricing race to the bottom like we saw with iPhone apps, and again, I certainly hope not.  Developers will be able to do much more on the iPad which will justify the higher price.  But should developers expect iPhone and iPod touch only users to pay $9.99 for an app not as feature rich as the iPad equivalent?  Or should iPad apps limit functionality to only what is feasible on both devices for the sake of a lower price point?

I wish I had answers to these questions.  I'm sure the answers will become clear once the iPad has been released and developers see and understand more, but for know I'm left scratching my head as I ponder these questions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey Peanut version 1.1 has just been released and is available in the App Store. I'm very excited about this update because it adds support for the new iPad, which will be available for purchase tomorrow. Best of all the update is free to existing users, so if you already bought Hey Peanut and you are getting an iPad then you will get the iPad version of Hey Peanut for free as well.

Haven't bought Hey Peanut for your toddler? No worries. The price will remain $1.99 and will include both the iPhone and iPad versions. It's like getting 2 apps for the price of 1.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was the last day for <a href="http://360idev.com">360idev</a> and what a great 4 days it has been. Catching up with friends, making new friends, listening to great talks, and yes, having a beer or four. This 360idev was extra exciting me for because I got a chance to talk. 

My presentation "Building Web Service Powered Apps" didn't start off great. There was a technical issue with my laptop and the projector that cause the talk to start late. Then as I tried to show an example of a web service call using the Twitter API I got a request limit reached error.

Despite the bumpy start and the shorten time frame, I think the talk was okay. Not great but okay. I wasn't able to talk through some of the points I had hoped to cover and I had to skip a couple of the demos. My plan is to record the skipped demos as a screen cast and post them here soon.

Thanks to all who came to my talk, and big thanks to the 360idev team, other speakers and the attendees who made the last few days in San Jose great.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few weeks ago I renamed the iPhone developer meet-up from NSiPhoneDevs to NSHappyHour. When I announced the name change I said I would follow up with the reasons behind the name change but I totally spaced and forgot.  Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jlbruno">@jlbruno</a> for reminding me to explain the reasons behind the change.

I came up with the name NSiPhoneDevs back at the beginning of the year.  I like the name because it's a good play on words, or rather a good play on prefixes.  "NS" is the class name prefix in the foundation framework used by iPhone and Mac developers, but "NS" also stands for North Shore. For those who don't know, Salem MA is located in Boston's North Shore area. So NSiPhoneDevs is short for North Shore iPhone Developers.

While I like the name it is not without it's problems.  First, NSiPhoneDevs doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.  I for one am guilty of saying "NSiDevs" on more than one occasion.  Another issue with the name is some may believe it excludes iPad developers.  This is a stretch I know but I'm sure with the release of the iPad there will be more new developers entering the space who consider themselves iPad developers.

The third, and most important reason for the name change, is the name NSiPhoneDevs excludes a major developer group, the Mac developer.  I talked with many Mac developers who said they are not interested in the group because it's iPhone only, and this includes Mac developers who also do iPhone development.  My intentions were never to exclude Mac developers. On the contrary, I want more Mac developers to come especially given that I'm doing more Mac desktop development these days.

The iPhone has attracted a large number of developers who come from other platforms including Windows, .NET, and Java.  The reasons for moving from another platform to the iPhone varies by developer.  Some are interested in mobile development.  Some are interested in joining in on the gold rush.  For others, including me, the reason is out of love for Cocoa, Objective-C, Xcode, and OS X.

I switched from Windows and web development to work in the world of Apple because, in my opinion, it provides the best developer experience.  Programming on my Mac, whether for the desktop or for the devices, is way more fun for me then in Windows, and I find the developer tools to be far better than anything else I have used in recent years.

So back to the NSHappyHour name change.  As someone who is also doing Mac development I did not want others in the Mac developer community to feel excluded.  After all, we all use a Mac for programming, we use Xcode as our developer IDE, and we work with many of the same core frameworks.  

This point hit home for me at <a href="http://nsconference.com/">NSConference</a> 2010 where I met a lot of people who share the same passion and love for the developer experience provided by the fruit company.  It was at this time I realized NSiPhoneDevs is the wrong name.  

The NSiPhoneDevs name is good because it builds off the hype that is the iPhone, but at the same time the name is bad because it does not recognized the development community as a whole. At the end of the day we all work with pretty much the same tools and we can learn a lot from one another whether you are writing iPhone/iPad only apps, desktop only apps, or doing all of the above.

So the group is now called NSHappyHour.  After all, that's what the group is really about.  Getting together with fellow Cocoa developers to talk shop over a few beers. So if you are writing code and producing apps for the iPhone, iPad and or Mac then NSHappyHour is the perfect gathering for you to socialize, learn, and network while enjoying tasty adult beverages.

		<title>I Paid for Microsoft&#039;s Mistake</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Update: A positive outcome as resulted from the blog post below. See the blog post <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/06/14/score-one-for-the-little-guy-and-kudos-to-microsoft/">Score One for the Little Guy and Kudos to Microsoft</a> for the latest news.

It's no secret that my dislike for Microsoft has grown in recent years, but today that dislike skyrocketed to a new level of anger that is rare for me. My growing dislike for Microsoft is centered around my belief that Microsoft's operating systems are not as good as the alternatives, their developer tools are not as good as the alternatives, and their productivity software programs are not as good as the alternatives. But today I'm angered not by Microsoft's technologies but by their unacceptable customer service.  I'm upset because I'm left with no other option than to pay for a mistake caused by Microsoft, and after dealing with the issue for years, I have yet to receive a single reply from a Microsoft employee.

The story begins in the fall of 2004.  Microsoft acquires Placeware, Inc and its online meeting solution now called Live Meeting.  I had recently started working full time for White Peak Software and was looking for an online meeting solution. Microsoft ran a special in December 2004 for it's newly acquired solution Live Meeting, $99 for a 1-year, 5-seat subscription.  For me it was a no brainer.  I signed up as soon as I heard about the offer.

Jump forward a year later to December 2005. Turns out I rarely used Live Meeting during my 12 month subscription so I canceled the service.  No harm, no foul. I tried the service and it wasn't for me.

Skip forward to 2007. I received an email from an Accenture contractor working on behalf of Microsoft. I can only assume he was working in the Accounts Receivable department. The email said I owed for a past due invoice. The invoice was attached to the email as some funky Word HTML format that I could not view. 

I asked that the invoice be resent in a viewable format, preferably as a PDF. I also stated in the reply email that I was unaware of any past due invoices related to Live Meeting. I explained I signed up for the service in December 2004, for 1 year then canceled in December 2005. I also included proof of payment for the 1 year subscription (dated December 28, 2004 and paid to Placeware), and I tried reaching the person via the phone.  I left voice mail.

I did not heard back from the Accenture person acting on behalf of Microsoft.  No reply email or returned phone call.  I assumed the matter was resolved.  Then in December 2007 I received email from another Accenture person acting on behalf of Microsoft once again saying I was past due on an invoice, which once again I could not view.  I asked that the invoice be sent in a viewable format, something other than this weird Word HTML, and I provided dates and proof of payment for my 1 year Live Meeting subscription dating from December 2004 through December 2005.  No surprise that I got zero responses, so I once again thought the matter had been resolved.

Now we jump ahead to July 2009, a year and a half since my last contact regarding this matter.  I got yet another email with yet another non-viewable attachment from the same Accenture person who emailed me in December 2007. Again I explained I could not view the invoice and asked that it be resent.  I also resent the proof of payments, dates, etc for my 1 year subscription started in December 2004 and ending December 2005.  Of course I got no reply, no viewable invoice, and again I was left with the assumption the matter was resolved though deep inside I knew better.

Today I got a voice mail from a collection agency regarding a past due invoice for a Live Meeting subscription.  A collection agency?  Seriously Microsoft?  After not returning my phone call or emails over the years, you turn the matter over to a collection agency?

I promptly called the collection agency back.  I talked with a friendly gentleman name Dan who shed light on the situation, something Microsoft and their Accenture contractors failed to do.

First, he tells me I am past due on an invoice date December 13, 2006 for a 1 year subscription to Live Meeting.  The subscription is for the period between December 13, 2006 and December 12, 2007, a full year <strong>after</strong> I had canceled my account. Not only that, he said his records show I started the account in December 2005, not in December 2004.  Of course my credit card statement says otherwise, showing a payment to Placeware, Inc on December 28, 2004. 

It turns out the past due invoice that has been in question for years and I was unable to view is from December 2006, a full year after my account was canceled. Not only that, Dan told me the invoice was mailed in December 2006 to my office address in New York City. I relocated the company to Salem, MA in March 2006, so that explains why I never received the original invoice. (Side note: He also email me a copy of the invoice, in PDF format. I was finally able to see the invoice for the very first time after all these years.)

Best I can tell the whole mess is due to an error on the Microsoft side, and if I had to guess it has something to do with Microsoft's acquisition of Placeware, Inc and the switch over in billing systems.  Remember, my payment was to Placeware in 2004 and my account was canceled in 2005. I was never asked or invoiced for the period between December 2005 and 2006. Then out of the blue comes an invoice in December 2006, sent to the wrong address, for the subscription period between December 2006 and December 2007.  And remember the collection agent said according to his records the account started in December 2005, yet there was no record of payment for the period between December 2005 and December 2006. That because the account was actually canceled in December 2005, not started.

It is obvious to me that there was some accounting error on the Microsoft side in 2006. Despite the error by Microsoft, I have no choice but to pay the outstanding invoice. I asked the collection agent if there is a contact at Microsoft that I can talk to about this matter. Short answer, "No", and past attempts to talk with Microsoft representatives also failed. 

So here we have it.  The big, mighty Microsoft with piss poor customer service chasing $99 thought to be owed to them by a small business and why? Because of an accounting mistake they made.  

I would love to talk with someone at Microsoft regarding this matter, not an Accenture contractor, not a collection agency, but a real live person from Microsoft. I would love to hear the reasons why my emails were never answered years ago.  I would love to hear why the records show my account was re-opened in 2005 and was never charged (obvious proof they screwed up).  And I would love to hear why out of the blue I was invoiced in December 2006 for the period December 2006 through December 2007 despite having canceled my account in December 2005.

I doubt I will ever hear from Microsoft.  Meanwhile I paid the invoice.  I guess Microsoft needs the money more than I do.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Kirbyt, I'm sorry to hear your story. 

A tip with collection agencies, ask them if they will 'delete'. This is credit lingo for removing the offending record completely from your credit report. If they will delete from all three, probably your cheapest option is to pay them off, then if you like, take MS to small claims court. Could make a fun series of blog posts...

Your other option is to document with the credit agencies that you did not actually owe the bill. With some nefarious (a-la Columbia House) groups,this is easy to do. Microsoft strikes me as probably harder, so for your own credit's sake,I might suggest you see if they'll delete, pay, and then sue the pants off them later in small claims court. Keep records of all the time you spend working on resolving this, and be sure to ask for extra damages!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple has come under fire over its latest developer agreement for iPhone OS developers.  The section causing concern is 3.3.1 which says applications must be originally written in Objective-C, C, and C++ (or JavaScript when using the WebKit engine).  This restricts developers from using other cross-platform development tools such as Adobe's Flash CS5 packager.

Steve Jobs has clearly explained his <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">thoughts on Flash</a>, but more importantly he talks about the impact felt from third party cross platform development tools. Those of us who have been in the software industry long enough will likely agree with Steve's comments regarding the impact cross platform development tools have on software development. 

An interesting fact: An abstraction layer separating the developer from the platform does not have to come from a third party to cause problems. When Microsoft first released Windows 7 the only way to take full advantage of the new features was to use a development tool that allowed the developer to talk directly with the platform, in this case the Windows API. This may come as a surprise to some but it meant you could not use .NET including C# to tap into the newest Windows 7 features. Microsoft's own layer, the .NET Framework, prevented C# developers from tapping into the latest features in Windows 7. A developer's only option at the time was to use Visual C++ or Delphi.

For years programmers have dreamed of some magical development tool that would allow them to write code once and run it anywhere. Sound familiar? That was the promise made by Java over a decade ago. Guess what. It never really happened. Most cross platform applications are subpar and do not feel or behave like applications written specifically for the platform. 

This brings me to a comment I read this morning in an <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/10/05/03/apple.could.dodge.ftc.complaints.with.sdk.change/">article</a> speculating Apple may change the iPhone developer agreement to avoid an antitrust case.

<quote>"Mobile advertiser Greystripe's CEO Michael Chang has explained that writing an app using Flash CS5 for the iPhone could cost $75,000 initially but would cost just a few thousand dollars more to port to Android. Without Adobe's tool, however, developers could be forced to rewrite from scratch and spend as much as they did before. The sheer expense could be considered anti-competitive as it would make writing for more than one platform cost-prohibitive for smaller studios."</quote>

First of all, writing a top quality cross platform application is hard and costly. It doesn't matter what development tools you are using. Second and more important, when did Flash CS5 become the <strong>only</strong> cross platform development option? Last time I checked C and C++ were considered cross platform programming languages with C being one of the more popular options for cross platform development. The iPhone developer agreement doesn't restrict the use of these cross platform programming languages.

Yes, it would be great if cross platform development were cheaper but to say the expense associated with cross platform development should be considered anti-competitive is just down right stupid. The developer agreement is not preventing cross platform development. It is preventing the use of third party cross platform abstraction layers that separate the developer from the platform. 

Why stop with Flash? Let's start a petition against Apple because I can't use my favorite programming language, Pascal. I think I should be able to use Pascal as my programming language of choice and not just for iPhone OS development. I want to use Pascal for any device and platform. Pascal should be a first class programming language for the Kindle, PSP and DSi, and Amazon, Sony and Nintendo should be responsible for making this happen otherwise face accusations of being anti-competitive.

This grumbling about section 3.3.1 in the iPhone developer agreement boils down to two things:

1) Businesses want to reduce development cost.

2) There are lots of lazy programmers out there.

Let's discuss these 2 points a bit further. Building a cross platform application using a tool like Flash CS5 might help businesses reduce development cost. Will it help a business be successful? Maybe and maybe not. Success depends on whether or not customers like the apps produced by the business. Personally I dislike non-native apps because most are subpar and behave differently. If the apps are subpar then a business will likely not succeed despite using third party cross platform development tools and saving a few dollars in development cost.

Now on to lazy programmers. Actually saying "lazy" is probably the wrong word to use. I often say I'm a good programmer because I'm lazy. I don't like to repeat the same task over and over, so I write a program to do the task for me.  This makes me lazy because I find ways to reduce the amount of work I need to do. So being a lazy programmer can actually be a good thing. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> principle is another example of being a good type of lazy programmer.

In my second point I'm referring to a different type of lazy programmer, a bad lazy programmer. This is typically a programmer who does programming as a job and programming is just that, a job. This type of programmer doesn't have the same love for programming that someone like me has. This type of programmer isn't interested in learning new programming languages and this type of programmer definitely is not the type who would be programming even if he or she didn't get paid to do it.

The bad lazy programmer wants everything to be easy. He wants to write an app once and have it run everywhere. He's main goal is to move up the corporate ladder in hopes of making more money. And what better way to move up the ranks than showing your company how it can reduce development cost by using a third party abstraction layer and tool.

These are the types of programmers complaining about section 3.3.1. Programmers too lazy to learn a new programming language such as Objective-C, C or C++. Yes, these languages are harder to learn than many of the newer programming languages including those fun scripting languages used by many today. And yes, I might be a little basis because I first learned C over 25 years ago and I have no problems using it today. But instead of bitching about terms in the developer agreement why not accept the fact that cross platform development is hard and costly. After all you can still use the same C and C++ code in both iPhone and Android apps. Yes, that's right. The <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html">Android NDK</a> (Native Development Kit) does exists and allows C and C++ code to be used to implement parts of your application. It's not easy but it's possible.

Adding more fuel to my fire is this comment in NY Post <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/an_antitrust_app_buvCWcJdjFoLD5vBSkguGO#ixzz0myFnh9pP">article</a> from yesterday:

<quote>"Regulators, this person said, are days away from making a decision about which agency will launch the inquiry. It will focus on whether the policy, which took effect last month, kills competition by forcing programmers to choose between developing apps that can run only on Apple gizmos or come up with apps that are platform neutral, and can be used on a variety of operating systems, such as those from rivals Google, Microsoft and Research In Motion."</quote>

Yes, exactly what world needs. Apps that are platform neutral. But wait! Don't we already have that today in the form of web-based apps? And doesn't the iPhone and iPad come with Mobile Safari capable of running web-based applications "that are platform neutral and can be used on a variety of operating systems"?

Ah, but you say you want native built apps that take advantage of the platform. That's cool. You can have that too. But this notation that you can have a native built app that is also platform neutral is just crazy talk. It's not going to happen anytime soon and it shouldn't be Apple sole responsibility to make it happen.

I wonder, if Objective-C were more popular would the torch carrying mob go after Google, Research in Motion, and Microsoft for not supporting it on their mobile devices?]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well said, Kirby. I'm completely amazed that everyone seems to be forgetting that developing for almost any mobile platform was a completely closed affair for all devices. It was exceedingly difficult, laborious, tightly-controlled and expensive. Apple actually liberated the whole field of mobile development, a model that is now being adopted by others.

That Apple doesn't now want to tip the balance completely in favor of letting their consumer devices be used as generic Turing machines is to Apple's credit. Both as a user and as a developer, I do not want cross-compiling to turn the phone/pad into a wasteland of bad software. There's already far too much now. If anything, I would like some stricter standards in place.

The idea that anyone is hog-tied by the SDK is absurd. It's one of the cheapest development enviroments you can use. The ecosystem is small-company friendly to a fault (anyone with virtually no budget can immediately start producing apps). One can already make use of endless reams of C-based libraries that have been developed over the last 20 years, including tons of open source. There's no concern about the ease of access or openness from a developer's perspective.

In response to Greg, I'd say that Apple is specifically trying to optimally impedance-match the development tools/languages/APIs to the hardware and services. Things like Flash are perfect examples of using a hammer when this dining room setup could use some classy silverware. It is perfectly within Apple's right (and the marketplace will punish Apple if they are wrong) to try to optimize this and keep out bad mismatches. No one was especially outraged that Java was kept off the phone.

The outrage seems only to be that Flash has such a huge share of the web software marketplace. Why isn't the spotlight on Adobe? How about we keep Flash off the phone/pad and instead let me cross-compile from Xcode directly into Flash for consumption on the web? Adobe seems to want it to be one way: Flash-&gt;Phone, but their logic is really just business logic. Adobe (and Flash developers) are just not being let in to Apple's ecosystem. Adobe/Macromedia has never let anyone into their ecosystem, however, either.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back in the day I used cvs for my source code repository. After some time i made the switch to Subversion which was an improvement over cvs. Recently I've been using Git for open source projects hosted on Github and I've been using git-svn for some of my Subversion repositories.

The more I use Git the more I like it. It's branch and merge support is awesome and the fact that I can still commit, view history, and so on when disconnected makes Git that much more awesome. So yesterday I decided to see what it takes to host a private centralized Git server for my repositories.

I'm requirements for a private Git server are simple. 

1) The server must be secure.
2) Adding new repositories must be quick and easy.
3) Cloning should use the git protocol, i.e., git clone @git:...
4) Daily backups.

I'm not much of a Linux server admin. I now enough to manage my own VPS slice at Slicehost.com. When it's time for me to do something new on the server I rely on helpful advice found via Goggle, and as expected Goggle did not let me down. I found this article which guided me through the steps for setting up a secured, private Git server.

It helped that I already had ssh and python setup on my server. As a result I was able to get my Git server up and running in a few minutes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I decided to do a little experiment earlier this week. I spent the day in Boston so instead of taking my laptop I decided to take only my iPad. I had no plans to write code that day but I had a number of other things I needed to do. Specifically write a new blog post, work on a book outline, and review and edits some documents. All the tasks can be accomplished on an iPad but what I wanted to know is how easy is it and how productive can I be.

Long story short, the experience was not good. I definitely wasn't as productive as I am with a laptop. The problem isn't with the device. The iPad is truly awesome and I believe it represents the future. The problem was inconsistencies with the various apps I used combined with the lack of features and or weird behaviors.

The experiment started on the commuter rail into Boston. The MBTA provides free wifi to riders, which was a plus for me. My iPad is wifi only, not the 3G model. With the free wifi access I was able to check my email, sync Instapaper, and post a tweet or two. The experiment was off to a great start.

The train ride into Boston was about 30 minutes so I decided to write a blog post about setting up a private centralized git server. If you follow this blog then you already know the posting isn't here. This is when the problems started.

I used the Wordpress app to write the blog post. The app does an okay job but it ain't <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. For starters there is no easy way to create links. Making matters worse, I wasn't able to paste in a URL from the clipboard. I ended up wasting a lot of time trying to get a link in the blog post but that was only the start of the problems.

I needed to switch to other apps as I wrote the post. Switching apps could be a bit easier on the iPad but I was multitasking, something some folks like to say is not supported. In switching between apps I discovered that the Wordpress app doesn't always save my data. In some cases the app could tell I had exited before saving and would tell me it had to recover the data next time I launched the app. The warning message is not necessary. Just return me to the edit screen, thank you very much.

In other cases something much worse happened. My data was lost...forever! The worse case happened after I had type three paragraphs only to have it lost. It was at this point I decided to give up on writing up the blog post and moved on to another task. 

I decided to work on an outline using Pages. As far as an editor goes, Pages is great and it doesn't have any of the short comings founding the Wordpress app. But Pages is far from perfect too.

The document I needed to edit was stored on Dropbox. The Dropbox app is awesome. I was able to go to my document and open it in Pages. Here's where I noticed the first problem. While I'm able to open a document stored on Dropbox in Pages there is no way to save the document back to Dropbox. Once the document was in Pages it stayed in Pages until I emailed it, posted it to iWork.com, or exported it for file sharing, which mind you requires a computer. So I was able to edit my document but I could not update Dropbox with the latest version. (Just to be clear, this is not a problem with Dropbox. The problem is with Pages.)

Another problem I encountered while working in Pages is access the toolbar for styling content in my document. My iPad is typically in landscape mode when I type but the toolbar is only accessible in portrait mode. This means I was continually rotating my iPad as I tried editing the document. This is a huge productivity killer for me and very annoying.

I also ran into another problem which is more behavioral than a problem with the device or apps. As I type my brain wants to Command+s to save as I go. Saving often has been hard wired into my head for most of my life. On the iPad in apps like Pages documents are autosaved. There is no need to Command+s but this doesn't stop my brain, or fingers for the matter, from trying to type the key combination. So what happens? I end up with lots of / characters randomly scattered throughout my document.

This brings up another issue. Apps on the iPad behave differently. For example the Wordpress app uses an edit screen with a Save button at the top. As I painfully learned the app does not autosave so I must touch the Save button, which I find myself doing often. Pages on the other hand autosaves. There is no explicit save action. This means my behaviors when using Pages must be different when compared to using the Wordpress app. It becomes annoying that different behaviors at required for different apps and this can hurt productivity.

Overall the experiment was useful. It opened my eyes up to the challenges we third party developers have when trying to create really useful apps. I also learned that while I can do many tasks on my iPad I'm still not as productive as I am on my laptop. I don't fault the device for this. It's the apps that are to blame. Inconsistent app behavior and lack of sharing data between apps impact productivity. But the good news is, this is only the beginning. The experience is only going to get better. Apps are going to get better. And it is only a matter of time before my iPad replaces my laptop for most of my daily activities.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month I had the fortunate opportunity to talk at <a href="http://www.360idev.com/">360idev</a>. My talk was on using web services in iPhone apps. The talk got off to a bad start due to various technical issues, the biggest issue caused when my MacBook Pro and the projector would not talk with one another. This caused my talk to start late which meant I had to skip some of the details I wanted to cover.

Another issue came up with I tried to demo a RESTful web service call to Twitter using <a href="http://ditchnet.org/httpclient/">HTTP Client</a>. Twitter reported the request limit had been reached for the IP address. This meant I had to skip over the Twitter related demos. Lucky for me, the rest of the presentation and demos ran smoothly.

For those who may have missed the presentation, the fine folks at 360idev have posted a <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/conference-videos#360idevsanjose2010">video recording of the session</a> available for purchase. You can also download the sample source code and the Keynote presentation file from my <a href="http://github.com/kirbyt/360idev">360idev repository</a> hosted on github.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Update: See the blog post <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/06/14/score-one-for-the-little-guy-and-kudos-to-microsoft/">Score One for the Little Guy and Kudos to Microsoft</a> for the latest news.

A few weeks ago I posted a story of how <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/04/26/i-paid-for-microsofts-mistake/">Microsoft turned me over to a collection agency</a> for a past due invoice that 1) I never originally received, 2) for an account canceled a year before the said invoice was issued, and 3) no one from Microsoft is willing to talk with me about to answer my questions. As a final straw and an attempt to put the matter behind me, I paid the invoice even though I still feel the invoice is the result of an accounting error made by Microsoft.

The blog post got the attention of a large number of people.  People were tweeting about my story and some popular web sites picked up the story.  The increased traffic to my web site brought down my server for 4 hours and I scrambled to get the site up and running again as quickly as possible. But more importantly the blog post caught the attention of some Microsoft employees. 

Two employees contacted me regarding the matter and offered to help.  This was great news.  I had hopes that I would finally have my questions answered.  After all, that's all I really want at this time, is to have my questions answered.

One of the Microsoft employees made some progress in finding a person to help figure out the mess.  It looked like I would finally have some answered. Then the collection agency called again. Yep, instead of Microsoft following up with me directly they asked the collection agency to call me.  

The agent I spoke with was the same person I spoke with last month. He said Microsoft ask him to call me to see what can be done to "smooth things over". I told the agent the same thing I told him last month. All I want is to talk with someone from Microsoft who can explain to me what happened. All I want is answered to my questions.

It is not about the money. Paying Microsoft $134 is not going to bankrupt White Peak Software. But what I really want is to speak with someone who can answer my questions regarding the matter. It's doubtful that will ever happen since Microsoft seems to prefer hiding behind contractors and collection agencies with limited information then to talk with me directly.

The fact that Microsoft will not talk with me directly makes me trust Microsoft less. Because I do not like doing business with companies I do not trust, it is likely the $134 I paid last month will be the last dollar Microsoft ever receives from me. The ironic part in all of this mess is Microsoft could have saved my trust in them as a consumer with a simple phone call.  

At the end of the day it is about providing great customer service and this is something that Microsoft has failed to do.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dude, there is nothing to stop the collection agency people from lying to you... About everything.  They will lie and say anything to get you to send them money.  It is legalized extortion, really. 

STOP TALKING TO THEM. TELL THEM TO CEASE AND DESIST. Preferable with a certified letter.

 As long as your talking to them Microsoft cant contact you- this is a common clause in such contracts.   Collection agency has no rights, only msft does and then only if the debt is legitimate.

You'll never hear from Microsoft as long as you continue to be a sucker..... As long as you keep talking to you handler at the collie tion agency they think they are getting closer to getting you to pay.

If you don't believe me, go read any coverage on this issue not written by a collection agency.]]></wp:comment_content>

Stay, Microsoft contacted me saying they were looking into the matter and would follow up.  But instead of following up directly Microsoft asked the collection agency to call me.  It's piss poor customer service at it's best.

There has been an interesting turn of events since posting this latest entry.  I'll post another other follow up as soon as I can. Long story short, I've been told Microsoft asked the collection agency to contact me and ask for a specific document. The agent who called did not do this. This makes the story even more interesting to me because Microsoft could have asked me directly for the document. What document is needed has not been disclosed to me.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/conference-videos#360idevsanjose2010">video recording of my 360idev</a> talk "Building Web Service Powered iPhone Apps" is now available from 360idev (free to attendees, for purchase for non-attendees). This was the first time a presentation I gave was recorded, and for the first time ever I get to see my own talk. I watched the video yesterday and overall I'm happy with the results. The best part for me, however, is using the video to learn from my mistakes.

A mistake I repeatedly made was not repeating questions asked by the audience. Repeating the question is an age old speaker tip, but the tip is easily forgotten during an actual presentation. Repeating the question is helpful to others in the audience who may not have heard the original question. Repeating the question also gives you a chance to make sure you understand the question, and it buys you a few more seconds while you think of an answer. 

Repeating the question becomes more important when your session is being recorded. In the case of the 360idev recording of my session, you cannot hear questions from the audience. This sometimes makes it hard to understand the context of the answer. I could have avoided this by repeating each question before providing an answer. The lesson learned here, and one I must remember the each time I speak, is to repeat the question before answering.

The other lesson I learned by watching my session is to not do live coding. Live coding can be impressive, earning you some respect points with audience members. But live coding can also slow down the presentation. This is what happened in my session. There are lulls during my talk while I type code from memory. Also audience members will often see mistakes in your code as you type and shout out tips. This can break your thought process causing confusion and delay.

Having now watched my session video I have decided to no longer do live coding in these types of sessions. The extra time spent typing on the keyboard is better spent sharing additional knowledge with the audience.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Turns out I'm nuts, and I can prove it. Last week a signed a contract to publish a book with Addison Wesley. Justin Williams at <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/">SecondGear</a> put it best when he asked, "ARE YOU NUTS!?" Yep, apparently I am. And signing the book contract is my proof.

Kidding aside, I'm very excited about this opportunity to contribute back to iPhone development community, a community that has been extremely helpful to me over the last couple of years. The book is on learning iPad programming. It will focus on the unique aspects of programming for the iPad and will hopefully serve as a launch pad for many new iPad programmer entering the space.

Writing on the book has just begun, and I have a very aggressive 6-month delivery schedule. My life is going to be busier than ever over the next 6 months, but it will be a good busy as this is something I have wanted to do for a long time. So if you don't hear from me much between now and November, you know why.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xcode is a suite of developer tools for Mac and iPhone programming. Xcode is also the IDE included in the developer tools. As far as IDEs go, Xcode has become my favorite over the years. It's simple yet powerful. But as good as it is, there's always room for improvement, so yesterday I <a href="http://twitter.com/kirbyt/status/14852962957">asked on Twitter</a>, what plugins do other Xcode developers find useful? Turns out there are a number of really useful Xcode plugins. Here is the list of favorites based on responses to my tweet.

<a href="http://macoscope.net/en/mac/codepilot/">Code Pilot</a> is by far the favorite based on the number of responses I received. Code Pilot provides easy navigation through your Xcode project. If you are a keyboard junkie like me than you owe it to yourself to try out Code Pilot.

<a href="http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html">Accessorizer</a> is the second most popular plugin. Accessorizer saves you time by generating boiler plate code for you. For instance, you can use Accessorizer to generate the @property declarations based on a set of ivars. Give the <a href="http://www.kevincallahan.org/AccessorizerDocuments/Accessorizer-QuickStartGuide.pdf">Accessorizer Quick Start Guide</a> (PDF) a read to get a sense of what Accessorizer can do for you.

<a href="http://rentzsch.github.com/mogenerator/">Mogenerator</a> tied for second most popular plugin. It generates Objective-C code for Core Data models. It works differently than Xcode in that Mogenerator manages two classes per entity, one intended for the machine and the other intended for humans. The Mogenerator sites says, "The machine class can always be overwritten to match the data model, with humans’ work effortlessly preserved." Perfect for Core Data projects. FYI, Mogenerator is an open source project created and maintained by the most-excellent <a href="http://rentzsch.com/">Jonathan 'Wolf' Rentzsch</a>.

<a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/completion-dictionary/index.html">Completion Dictionary</a> is a free plugin that enhances Xcode's own code completion. It allows you to define your own expansion macros. You type a few letters and press the completion shortcut. You instantly have new code added to the file. This plugin reminds me of Delphi Live Templates, which I used religiously back when I did lots of Delphi programming. Oh, and did I mention Completion Dictionary is free?

What other Xcode plugins are out there? Which ones do you find useful? Post a comment if you have a favorite plugin not listed here.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few weeks ago I was having some post-CocoaHeads beers with <a href="http://outerlevel.com/">Jon Trainer</a> and <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/">Daniel Jalkut</a>. We were talking about the success I've had with Labor Mate. They both insisted I raise the price from $0.99 to something higher. Both had sound reasons why a price increase would work for Labor Mate. For instance, the price range for competing apps range is from free to $9.99. A higher price point will help Labor Mate stand out. Everything Jon and Daniel said made sense, but I was skeptical.

For those who don't know, Labor Mate is a niche app for the iPhone. It has been in the Top 100 in the Health and Fitness category for multiple App Stores including the U.S. for more than a year. Back in November Labor Mate's status in the Health and Fitness category started to drop due to two competitors being mentioned in the What's Hot lists. Despite the drop in rankings Labor Mate continues to sale well, slowly and steadily earning more money per month. A big part of this success comes from international sales, which have steadily improved since translating Labor Mate into 8 other languages. Another part of the success comes from the fact that the app is rock solid. It doesn't crash, and as one of the reviewers recently said about Labor Mate, "Maybe not the slickest looking app for counting contractions, but we didn't want to risk crashing or accidentally losing data - we just wanted a reliable app that would work under pressure."

Even though I was not confident of a positive outcome, I decided to follow the advice from Jon and Daniel. I raised the price of Labor Mate from $0.99 to $1.99. My plan was to leave it at the higher price for a minimum of one week. As expected the first full day at the new price saw spike in revenue. However, sales dropped. This trend continued for the first week. As a result, Labor Mate lost most of its visibility in the App Store's Top 100 for Health and Fitness. I figured it was only a matter of time before sales and revenue hit an all time low.

Despite what appeared to be a downward trend, I decided to continue the pricing experiment for a second week. To my surprise sales started to return to its normal pattern, a spiky, Bart Simpson-like hair cut. What I noticed was exactly what Jon and Daniel said would happen. I started making more money. Jon and Daniel were right! Sure, daily unit sales were lower than before the price increase, but revenue was higher for those two weeks. So while Labor Mate dropped from the rankings of the Top 100 in the Health and Fitness category and the number of units sold per day dropped, in the end I made more money.

The next big question now is, will Labor Mate revenue continue its slow but steady climb at this higher price point, or will the overall trend start heading downwards? I've decided to keep Labor Mate at the $1.99 price for another week to see what happens.

Meanwhile, for those of you who prefer looking at charts, I've included the sales and revenue charts for Labor Mate covering the time period between April 1, 2010, and May 31, 2010. There was a spike in mid-April but sales started dropping afterwards. The red-dash line is the first full day at the new, higher price. The spike on that day was almost as high as the spike in April.

		<title>Using UIPopoverController with iOS 4</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I ran into an interesting bug today while testing Hey Peanut on iOS 4. For those who don't know, Hey Peanut is a universal binary, which means it runs on both the iPhone and iPad. My iPhone has the GM version of iOS 4 installed on it, which I'm using to test my apps under iOS 4. 

Because Hey Peanut can run on both the iPhone and iPad, my code must include certain checks to avoid crashes. One check the code makes is to determine if the class UIPopoverController is available or not. Prior to iOS 4, this class was only available in iOS 3.2. The current release of iOS on the iPhone is version 3.1.3, and it does not include this class. To make use of the popover I use code such as the following:

<pre class="code">
   Class popoverControllerClass = NSClassFromString(@"UIPopoverController");
   if (popoverControllerClass) {
      popoverController_ = [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:[self imagePicker]];
   }
</pre>

Turns out there is a big problem with this code under iOS 4 causing Hey Peanut to crash each time. It wasn't obvious to me at first why this code was failing but as I thought it more, and as I talked through the issue with an Apple engineer, I realized, "Duh! iOS 4 is running on the iPhone, not the iPad." Simply checking for the existence of the class isn't good enough any more. Instead, I need to also check the device type. So with a quick change to the code, shown below, I was able to fix the crash in Hey Peanut. The code now checks that the class is available and is running on a iPad.

<pre class="code">
   Class popoverControllerClass = NSClassFromString(@"UIPopoverController");
   if (popoverControllerClass <b>&& UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad</b>) {
      popoverController_ = [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:[self imagePicker]];
   }
</pre>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In April I blogged about an <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/04/26/i-paid-for-microsofts-mistake/">issue I was having with Microsoft</a> regarding a questionable past due invoice. I'm happy to report that the issue has finally been resolved. Microsoft owned up to the mistake and will be issuing a refund for full amount paid to the collection agency.

Long story short, the payment I made in December 2004 was applied to the December 2005 invoice. This basically resulted in me getting the first year of service for free, though I didn't know it. And I never received the December 2005 invoice because it had been paid with the money charged in December 2004. Also, when the billing system was moved from Placeware to Microsoft, a mistake was made to my account which caused the December 2006 invoice not to be sent to me. Because I never received invoices for December 2005 and December 2006, it's logical to see how I thought the account was canceled after the first year of service, which started in December 2004.

Thanks to the blog post in April, Microsoft did in fact contact me regarding the issue. If not for the attention received by the posting, I would have remained bitter towards Microsoft. Instead, an extremely helpful Julie McNamara-Dahl from Microsoft went above and beyond to get to the bottom of the issue. Julie's efforts have single handedly restored my trust in Microsoft's customer service. And best of all, with the help of others at Microsoft, she was able to get to the bottom of the matter and answer my question, "What happened?"

I hate that the matter blew up like this, and I hate that it was something haunting me for years. But in the end, the whole affair proved to me that Microsoft does listen and does strive to provide excellent customer service. 

Finally, I want to say a big thank you to Julie and those who helped her. THANK YOU! This matter is definitely closed.]]></content:encoded>

I had hoped to get an update to the App Store before today but I've been waiting for the new artwork for iPhone 4. I will be submitting the update to Apple as soon as possible. The bug, for those curious, causes Hey Peanut to crash when you touch the camera icon to add new photos.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month I mentioned my <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/06/01/sales-are-down-but-revenue-is-up/">experiment with the pricing</a> for Labor Mate to see what effects, if any, a price increase will have. The initial results were interesting. The number of units sold went down, but revenue had gone up. On the surface it seems the price increase was a success, but I needed more data.

I increased the price of Labor Mate by $1 on May 15, going from $0.99 to $1.99. By increasing the price on May 15, I was able to compare the first half of the month with the second half. And as I mentioned in the previous <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/06/01/sales-are-down-but-revenue-is-up/">post</a> revenue had indeed gone up. But I was curious to see if this would continue and what might be the long term effects, so I left Labor Mate at $1.99. After all, I made more money in May as a result of the price increase.

June is over and the sales numbers are in. I'm now able to compare a full month of sales (for June) at the higher $1.99 price to a full month of sales (for April) at the lower $0.99 price. And I can compare these numbers to May's numbers. The results might be surprising to some, but are inline with what I secretly thought would happen.

In June, Labor Mate earned a whooping $31.94 more money than in April, and it earned $30.90 <strong>less</strong> compared to May. In April, Labor Mate averaged $35 per day. The average was $37 per day in May, and only $36 per day in June. 

Revenue from Labor Mate has been on a slow but steady increase since it was first released back in 2008. Though I cannot prove it, based on past trends, my gut tells me Labor Mate would have likely hit June's revenue number in May without the price increase. And my gut, again based on the trend, says June would have probably hit May's number without the price increase. In other words, while the price increase did improve Labor Mate's revenue, the amount of additional revenue resulting from the price increase is actually no different from the slow and steady increase in revenue I was already seeing at the lower, 99 cent price point. As a matter of fact, I saw a bigger jump in revenue between March and April, with April bringing in a whooping $175.71 more than March.

I'm now convinced the price increase did little to improve revenue, and actually the price increase likely did more harm than good. Prior to the price increase Labor Mate was ranked in the Top 100 in the Health and Fitness category for a number of different countries including the U.S. Today Labor Mate is no were near ranking in the Top 100 in most stores.

Another negative effect caused by the price increase is that fewer people are now using Labor Mate. As I noted in the previous <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/06/01/sales-are-down-but-revenue-is-up/">post</a>, the number of daily downloads dropped. This means fewer people are buying Labor Mate, which in turns means fewer people are using it. I believe Labor Mate's slow but steady raise was due in part to word of mouth advertising. Now that there are fewer new moms and dads buying and using Labor Mate, there are fewer people recommending Labor Mate to other new moms and dads. And I admit, ignoring price for a moment, I'm a little disappointed that fewer people are using the app. A part of me prefers selling at a lower price point so more mom and pops to be will use it. (Hmm, maybe I should release a free, iAd supported version.)

So what's next? I've thought about dropping the price back down to 99 cents, but this could lead to a backlash from the folks who purchased Labor Mate over the last 6 weeks. Plus, $1.99 is still cheaper than a large cup of Starbucks coffee. The better idea, and the one I have been planning all along, is to continue improving Labor Mate and make it stand out above the other 99 cent copy cats. This includes leaving the price at $1.99 for now. After all, as one recent new user said to me in email, "it is a very practical and intuitive app and certainly justified at $1.99."]]></content:encoded>

Your point about dropping out of the top 100 apps in Health could also be because there are alot more (good?) apps coming in that category, so that would be the other number to compare to if you are really bothered by it. :-)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jonathan Kardos has an excellent article on Boston Innovation explaining <a href="http://bostinnovation.com/2010/07/08/how-to-find-a-mobile-app-developer-in-boston/">how to find a mobile app developer in Boston</a>. <a href="http://nshappyhour.org">NSHappyHour</a> even gets a mention, which is great. But one thing left out of Jonathan's article are national events such as <a href="http://360idev.com">360idev</a>. 

Speaking from personal experience, attending events like 360idev is a great way to not only meet and network with developers but for developers to find work, whether they are looking for a permanent position or contract work. This is one of the many reasons I return to 360idev event after event, and why I will be at the next one in Austin TX on November 7th through the 10th.]]></content:encoded>

It seemed like a fun exercise to break up the night, so I said, "Sure, why not." 

I decided others might find the sample source code useful so I posted the project to <a href="http://github.com/kirbyt/SimpleTimer">github</a> for all to enjoy. The piece devs might find interesting is the KTStopwatch class. This is a simplified version of the class I use in Labor Mate. It supports wall clock and elapsed time.

The source code is licensed using The MIT License, so do with it what you like. Enjoy.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Life has been crazy busy over the last week but fun at the same time. I'm wrapping up a client project, and last week I spoke about iPad programming at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/newyork-iphone-developers/">NYC iPhone Developer Meet-up</a>. The next day I followed up the talk with a one-day training class on learning iPad programming. Thanks goes out to <a href="http://twitter.com/juliobarros">Julio Barros</a> of <a href="http://www.e-string.com/">E-String</a> for keeping me busy last week, I mean for giving me the opportunity to talk and teach.

One of the more interesting things that happened last week was being interviewed by a reporter from the largest news service in China. Here's a <a href="http://yfrog.com/msa3yxj">picture from the interview</a>, and yes, I look like a zombie in the picture. The reported asked some really good questions, and I think the interview went really well. But it's doubtful I'll ever see the interview since it will only air in China and the interview is unlikely to be available online. Still, it was fun to do.

A highlight from last week was seeing friends, old and new, Thursday night for drinks after the meet up. Made me realize how much I miss living in New York.]]></content:encoded>

Hey Peanut 1.3 was submitted to Apple today. This update includes a new safari theme for toddlers to enjoy. There is a hippo, giraffe, zebra, and a friendly lion. Also included in this update are all new animal sounds recorded from actual animal.

Previous releases of Hey Peanut used family-made sounds. What do I mean by "family-made" sounds? Well, the animal sounds were recordings of my wife and me attempting to mimic each of the farm animals. The sounds were silly but lacked a certain level of professionalism. Hey Peanut 1.3 will use all new sounds, and this time the animal sounds are the actual sounds from real animals, with one exception. A giraffe doesn't really make a sound, so in Hey Peanut the giraffe sounds like a giggling kid.  Of course, that kid giggling is my son, <a href="http://www.rowanturner.net/">Rowan</a>, so there is still a family touch in this new release.

Hey Peanut 1.3 should be available for download from the App Store very soon.  Meanwhile, keep an eye on the White Peak Software Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/whitepeak">@whitepeak</a>, for promo codes to redeem a free copy of Hey Peanut (U.S. App Store only).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Don&#039;t Rely on UIDevice orientation for Rotation</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week I tweeted about having rotation issues with an iPad app I'm working on. This is the second time in recent weeks I've encountered rotation issues in an app. In both instances I was using a <em>UIScrollView</em> so I started thinking the <em>UIScrollView</em> was source of my problems. In the most recent instance the <em>UIScrollView</em> contains a <em>UIView</em> that uses a number of <em>CALayer</em> instances for content display.

For those who don't know, in Mac OS X 10.5 and greater, <em>CALayer</em> has the <em>autoresizingMask</em> property. Unfortunately this property does not exists under iOS, so it's up to my code to do the resizing CALayers as needed. This is where the rotation issue revealed itself.

As the device is rotated from portrait to landscape, or vice versa, my view must resize and adjust the layout of the CALayers. Because <em>UIView</em> does not receive the rotation notifications I decided to be smart and use the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIDevice_Class/Reference/UIDevice.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006902-CH3-SW3">orientation property</a> from <em>UIDevice</em>. So in my view I had code similar to this:

[objc]
UIInterfaceOrientation interfaceOrientation = [[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation];
if (UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscape(interfaceOrientation) == YES) {
  // Adjust for landscape.
} else {
  // Adjust for portrait.
}
[/objc]

What I failed to realize, however, is that the property <em>orientation</em> will <strong>always</strong> return 0 unless orientation notifications are enabled. Here is a quote directly from the Developer Documentation:

<cite>"The value of this property always returns 0 unless orientation notifications have been enabled by calling beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications."</cite>

Doh! Guess I should have RTFM sooner.

Because the <em>orientation</em> property will return 0, sometimes the view in my app would not rotate. But I didn't know this was the source of the problem at the time.

After banging my head over and over on the wall, I decided to investigate exactly what was happening. I never suspected [[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation] but eventually I noticed it was returning 0. This seemed odd so I checked the Developer Documentation. I wasn't expecting to learn anything new. Boy, was I wrong. I was surprised when I read the property always returns 0 when orientation notifications are not enabled.

I now knew the source of my rotation problems, and a likely quick fix to the problem would have been to call beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications, get the device orientation, then call endGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications. But this just seemed wrong to me. The better fix, in my opinion, is to rely on the rotation notifications received by the view controller, so that's exactly what I did.

Now in my particular situation, there are two times I want to resize and layout the CALayers in the <em>UIView</em>. One of those times is when the device is rotated, which is when the view controller receives the <em>willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:</em> message. This was easy to solve. I added an <em>adjustLayoutToInterfaceOrientation:</em> method to my <em>UIView</em> and I call the method inside the UIViewController's <em>willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:</em> method. For example:

[objc]
- (void)willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation 
                                duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration 
{
   [view_ adjustLayoutToInterfaceOrientation:toInterfaceOrientation];
}
[/objc]

The other time my <em>UIView</em> needs to adjust the layout of the CALayers is when the <em>UIScrollView</em> scrolls. I'm using a modified version of Matt Gallagher's <a href="http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/01/multiple-virtual-pages-in-uiscrollview.html">virtual pages in a UIScrollView</a> approach, so the contents of my view changes as the user scrolls. This is where, previously, I was trying to be smart and use the <em>orientation</em> property from <em>UIDevice</em>. But what I really need is the current orientation as received in the most recent call to <em>willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:</em>.

My solution was to add the ivar currentOrientation to my view controller. My view already has a reference to the view controller. I exposed currentOrientation so my view can retrieve the property value. This allowed me to replace the <em>[[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation]</em> code with <em>[controller currentOrientation]</em>. Now the view always knows the current orientation and the app does not need to enable orientation notification in code.

As a result, the first code snippet in this posting changes to:

[objc highlight="1"]
UIInterfaceOrientation interfaceOrientation = [controller_ currentOrientation];
if (UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscape(interfaceOrientation) == YES) {
  // Adjust for landscape.
} else {
  // Adjust for portrait.
}
[/objc]

And the <em>willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:</em> implementation changes to:

[objc highlight="4"]
- (void)willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation 
                                duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration 
{
   currentOrientation_ = toInterfaceOrientation;
   [view_ adjustLayoutToInterfaceOrientation:toInterfaceOrientation];
}
[/objc]

This has been an eye opener for me, and I now have a new rule of thumb. Never use <em>UIDevice orientation</em> in code that is responsible for the resizing and layouts of subviews and CALayers.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I admit I don't have a strong need for a stylus when using my iPad, but there have been occasions when I wish I had one. Using my finger to take notes in a drawing app is sometimes frustrating to me. My finger drawn text is usually too large, and on hot summer days, my finger doesn't always glide smoothly over the surface of my iPad. So I decided to give an stylus a try. The problem was, which stylus to buy.

I narrowed my search down to two styluses, the <a href="http://www.tenonedesign.com/sketch.php">Pogo Sketch</a> from Ten One Design and the <a href="http://www.boxwave.com/products/capacitivestylus/apple-ipad-capacitive-stylus_3779.htm">Boxwave Capacitive iPad Stylus</a>. I spent more time than I should have reading reviews of both only to come to the conclusion: I don't know which one to buy. So I bought both.

The Pogo Sketch gets points for price ($10.78 on Amazon at the time), which is much less than the Boxwave ($20.95 plus $4 shipping). Both work well on my iPad. The Pogo Sketch is longer and thinner, and felt cheaper than the Boxwave. The Boxwave stylus is heavier and thicker, much like a nice ball point pen, but it is short. I personally don't mind the shortness since I've carried short pens in my pocket for most of my life, but others might not care for it.

The tip on the Pogo is shaped differently than on the Boxwave. With the Pogo tip, I can hold the stylus in different positions as I draw, sort of like a pencil. The Boxwave, on the other hand, is like using a pen. I find myself holding it in the same position as I would a pen. 

The Pogo tip also looks like it could wear out quickly. With both styluses I must use more pressure to draw than I would with pencil and paper. I can't help but feel I will flatten out the Pogo tip quickly with regular use. On the other hand, the Boxwave tip looks and feels solid, and I don't have the same concern of it wearing out.

After spending time with both, I decided I prefer the Boxwave Capacitive iPad Stylus over the Pogo Sketch. I like the thickness and weight of the Boxwave, and it doesn't have that cheap feel that the Pogo does. But $25 is a lot to spend. Given the amount of time I will use a stylus and having played with both, I know I would have been happy with the Pogo Sketch. But since I bought both, I will continue using the Boxwave stylus, and I will likely give away the Pogo Sketch at an <a href="http://nshappyhour.org/">NSHappyHour</a> or similar event.

Speaking of NSHappyHour, I brought both styluses with me to the July NSHappyHour for others to try out. Jon Lee was kind enough to email me his own review, which I've included here. I love his final verdict.

<blockquote>
<em>Finger:</em>

Pros: Always available when you need it.  If you lose one, there is always another.

Cons: Pen tip is too squishy, and big.  Writing by finger is an awkward user experience.


<em>Pogo Sktech</em>

Pros: Tip feels smaller, like you're drawing with a thin Crayola marker.  Using a stylus is familiar as a experience, as compared to finger painting.

Cons: The squishy sponge material makes me afraid that if I press too hard I will scratch the iPad surface with the edge of the ring that holds the sponge.  Sponge feels very rippable after continued use.


<em>Boxwave Capacitive iPad Stylus</em>

Pros: Good weight, feels substantial.  The tip, being rubber, feels like it could last longer than the Pogo.

Cons: The rubber end is like the bulb end of a turkey baster.  And it feels like you're writing with one.  The thicker footprint does not make me feel like I have a high chance of being accurate when I draw.  And $20?  Really?


Verdict:
<a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/05/collins_lab_diy_ipad_stylus.html">Make your own</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today is my final update on the pricing experiment I started back in May. You can read the previous posts <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/06/01/sales-are-down-but-revenue-is-up/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2010/07/02/sale-numbers-are-in-an-update-on-my-app-store-pricing-experiment/">here</a>. The goal of the experiment was to see if the sales trend for Labor Mate would continue at the higher price of $1.99. After three full months, I can say the higher price has done more harm than good.

Labor Mate continues to bring in over $1K per month despite the higher price, but the trend doesn't look good. Over the last few weeks, the number of sales has decreased everywhere except in Japan. For some reason, sales are up in Japan and if not for Japanese sales in August, Labor Mate would have posted it's worse sales month in 6 months.

Since it's inception date, revenue for Labor Mate has been on a slow but steady rise. The higher price has reversed that trend. Labor Mate now appears to be on a slow but steady fall. Not only that, Labor Mate, which at one time was in the Health and Fitness Top 100 category in App Stores throughout the world, is not longer visible on any Top 100 chart, anywhere. This three month pricing experiment maybe the start of a slow death for Labor Mate, but it's not done for yet.

I have big plans in the works, and a new update is just around the corner. I was planning a big release in a few weeks that would hopefully justify the $1.99 price tag in the eyes of consumers but I'm changing my strategy.  Starting today, Labor Mate is back down to 99 cents, and instead of a big update in a few weeks, I'm going to release 3 or 4 updates over the next 1 to 2 months. My goal here is to get Labor Mate back on track and return to the trend I was seeing before the price increase.

Update: One thing I should point out is Labor Mate has a lot of competition. The other similar apps cost between free and 99 cents. This maybe a key reason why a $1.99 Labor Mate cannot sustain the slow but steady growth seen by the 99 cent Labor Mate.]]></content:encoded>

My finger-in-the-air analysis matches yours.  I think the mixture of good enough (means ratings of 4+) and cheapest wins the most volume in the App Store.  Thanks for sharing though and good luck getting the momentum back!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fall is almost here and it's going to be a busy on for me. Not only will I be heads down trying to finish my upcoming book, I will be speaking at two iOS developer conferences. The first conference is <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/iphonefall2010/">Voices That Matter</a> in Philadelphia on October 16 and 17. This will be my first VTM, and I'm very excited to be apart of the event. There are a lot of great talks planned for the 2-day conference. My talk will be on the advantages of writing universal apps for iPad and iPhone. Early bird pricing ends today so register now to save money. Use the discount code PHASPKR to save even more money.

The second conference I'm speaking at this fall is <a href="http://www.360idev.com/">360iDev Austin</a>. It's no secret that 360iDev is one of my favorite developer conferences. I have made numerous friends since attending my first 360iDev last year, and the networking I've done at past 360iDev conferences has help land me paying gigs. My session at 360iDev will be on the fundamentals of iPad programming. This session is intended for anyone just starting out with iPad programming. Earlier bird pricing as already ended for 360iDev Austin but even at the full price of $599, it is money well spent if you are serious about iOS programming.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CustomNavBar.png" alt="CustomNavBar.png" border="0" width="200" align="left" vspace="6" hspace="6" /> I've recently worked on a number of iOS projects that require a custom background for the UINavigationBar including the navigation bar used by the UINavigationController. Customizing the look of a UINavigationBar is actually pretty simple. You can set the tintColor property to the color of your choice. But sometimes you need to do more. For example, say you want to have a title in your navigation bar that uses a font not available on iPad and iPhone. For this you will need to use an image to customize the navigation bar. 

Let's take a look at the various ways to customize the navigation bar.

The UINavigationBar has a style property called barStyle. barStyle can be set to UIBarStyleDefault or UIBarStyleBlack. The default uses a blue gradient background. When using UIBarStyleBlack you can also set the translucent property to YES to give the navigation bar a partially opaque look.  If you are using Interface Builder, then you will set the Style property in the Inspector window. Here you have the option to style the navigation bar as Default, Black Opaque, and Black Translucent. 

What if you want a color other than blue and black? You can set the tintColor property (aka Tint in IB) to any color you like. This changes the navigation bar's color. Best of all, setting the tintColor will also change the background color used by the bar button items displayed within the navigation bar. 

Sometimes, however, just changing the tint of the UINavigationBar isn't enough. Sometimes you want to have a fancier background. Maybe the background you want has a different gradient style or lighting effect, or maybe you want a title displayed in the center of the navigation bar to use a font not available in iOS. How would you change the look of the navigation bar for these scenarios? Simple. You use an image that is drawn on the navigation bar.

There are two approaches you can use to draw an image on the navigation bar. You can create a new class that inherits from UINavigationBar and override the drawRect method. For example:

[objc]
@interface KTNavigationBar : UINavigationBar {

}
@end

@implementation KTNavigationBar

- (void) drawRect:(CGRect)rect
{
   [super drawRect:rect];
   
   UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed: @&amp;amp;amp;quot;navbar.png&amp;amp;amp;quot;];
   [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height)];
}

@end
[/objc]

In this example, the image navbar.png is used to customize, or skin, the UINavigationBar. This is a nice, clean, object orientated way to customize the look of your navigation bar. The only thing you must remember to do is to use your custom UINavigationBar class within your application. This means changing the class type for those of us using IB.

Another trick you can use that doesn't require changing the class type is to use a category. For example:

[objc]
@interface UINavigationBar (KTCustomLook)

- (void) drawRect:(CGRect)rect;

@end


@implementation UINavigationBar (KTCustomLook)

- (void) drawRect:(CGRect)rect
{
   UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed: @&amp;amp;amp;quot;navbar.png&amp;amp;amp;quot;];
   [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height)];
}

@end
[/objc] 

I admit I have used this approach in more than one project, but doesn't feel right to me. It feels more like using voodoo or black magic then following good OO design. But this approach does work and it does save you time by eliminating the need to change the class type for each instance of UINavigationBar within your app. [Update: This approach doesn't feel right because it overrides a method in a category. You should know this is a bad, bad thing, and I don't encourage others to do it. That said, it does work.]

One thing to note when using an image to customize the UINavigationBar, you still want to set the tintColor for the navigation bar. As I mentioned, setting this property will also change the background color used by the bar button items. So you want to set the tintColor to the appropriate color making the button color fit in with the navigation bar color style.

For those of you who want to see these concepts in action, I posted a <a href="http://github.com/kirbyt/CustomNavBar">sample project, called CustomNavBar</a>, on github. Enjoy.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Life has been crazy busy recently. Of course it seems my life is always crazy busy, and just when I think it can't get any more crazy busy, it does. I'm behind on a number of things, and I can't help but feel overwhelmed. Heck, feeling overwhelmed is probably an understatement for how I feel right now. 

This year has been an amazing year for me, work-wise. I reinvented White Peak Software last year as company focused on iOS, and this year is shaping up to be my most exciting and enjoyable year in the company's (almost) 7 year history. But a number of things are suffering as well. Progress on the book is suffering. Product updates are suffering. New product releases are suffering. Even client work is suffering because there's simply no way for me to keep up with the demands. Despite of all this, I feel a bit better this evening after reading a posting from Jeff LaMarche. 

I look up to Jeff, and I'm amazed at how much work he pumps out. I often wonder where he finds the time - not having a two year old in the house probably helps - and I'm convinced he never sleeps. In his posting <a href="http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/09/complaining-about-success.html">Complaining About Success</a>, Jeff mentions "time has become a scarce commodity."

Ah, he is human. He does fall behind from time to time.

While I feel for Jeff, I admit reading his post makes me feel a bit relieved that I'm not alone.

And Jeff, if you are reading this, I plan to stick with the <a href="http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/09/dealloc.html">release then nil</a> approach. It's the approach I learned when first diving into Objective-C. Old habits are sometimes hard to break.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday Apple announced the Mac App Store, which will be available in 90 days. The Mac App Store is modeled after the iOS App Store. The store provides customers a trusted way to buy and download safe, quality software for the Mac OS X desktop. As with the iOS App Store, software developers must submit their apps to Apple for review, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/appstore/mac/resources/approval/guidelines.html">apps must adhere to a list of rules</a>, and Apple gets 30% of the app price for each unit sold.

My first impression when reading about the announcement was 30% is too high. E-commerce providers such as Fastspring and eSellerate charge a much lower percentage. But the Mac App Store does do a few things that other e-commerce providers do not. The Mac App Store has the potential to reach many more users given that the app will be available on the desktop. Also, the Mac App Store will host the download file. But when I think about it, none of this is new. The only thing new is Apple.

Download sites have existed for years. The <a href="http://pad.asp-software.org/spec/spec.php">PAD specification</a>, which has been available for years, provides a mechanism for software vendors to publish app metadata and be discovered by download sites, and ultimately by customers. And many download sites and e-commerce providers provide hosting of the app. Even Microsoft gave it a try with its web-based app store concept called <a href="http://www.windowsmarketplace.com/">Microsoft Marketplace</a>, which after many years is no more. So it seems to me, the only thing new and different about the Mac App Store is the review process. 

Downloading desktop software from download sites can be risky. You never know if the software you download contains a virus or malware. Attempts such as pre-scanning software for viruses by download sites have been made to instill trust but at the end of the day it's hard to trust software downloaded from these sites. The <a href="http://www.asp-software.org/">Association of Software Professionals</a> have attempted tackling the trust issue for years and has had some success. Still, at the end of the day, gaining customer trust with an online business is challenging.

Personally, I never download software from download sites but I buy a lot of software online. I only buy and download software from the vendor's own web site, and I'll only do it when I feel I can trust the vendor. The vendor earns my trust by having a professional online presence, provides contact information with bonus points for having a physical address and phone number, offers a money back guarantee, and most importantly digitally signing the software with a certificate from a trusted CA. If you browse the White Peak Software web site, you'll see I follow these trust rules myself.

Trust is important when doing business in the online world, and the Mac App Store will help gain customer trust. This should, in turn, help encourage customers who have never bought desktop software online to final do so. The added level of trust and the potential reach to new customers makes the 30% cut to Apple worth while in my opinion. But I still have concerns, from a developer's point of view, about the Mac App Store.

Many existing, and popular, apps sold today including some from Apple will be rejected from the store based on the list of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/appstore/mac/resources/approval/guidelines.html">review rules</a>. But a bigger concern for me is that software vendors wishing to sell through the Mac App Store as well as through their own company web site will be required to maintain two different versions of the same app. Mac App Store apps cannot be self updating, cannot be trial version, and cannot use its own licensing scheme. These three things are key components to selling desktop software on the Internet today. This means a software vendor wishing to sell an app through the Mac App Store as well as through its own company store must have two separate builds of the app, one build without the self updating, trial version, and licensing scheme for the Mac App Store, and one build containing these features for sell through one's own online store.

Another concern I have with the Mac App Store is the lack of pricing and licensing options. For example, Killink CSV is a business app bought by individuals and large companies alike. By selling directly to the customer, I can offer various pricing and licensing options. I offer a volume discount on purchases. The more single user licenses you buy, the lower the per unit cost. I offer a site license option too, which allows customers to pay a lower price while being able to install the software on a greater number of computers. Then there are coupons. I use coupons to offer discount pricing for a variety of reasons. It's doubtful the Mac App Store will support coupons in the next 90 days. Then there are affiliates. While sells from affiliates represents only a small portion of my product revenue, affiliates do bring in additional customers. Come to think of it, in a way, one could think of the Mac App Store as an affiliate with review process.

I can't help but wonder...giving the fact that I have more control over pricing, can offer discounts, and run sales using coupons...will customers become annoyed when they pay one price for my app in the Mac App Store only to find out they could have saved money by buying directly? And how will customer support change with the introduction of the Mac App Store? I'm assuming Apple will not provide any customer information after a purchase to the software vendor. What happens when a customer calls or emails me about re-installing the app on a new computer? I'll have to first find out how they purchased the app, through the Mac App Store or through my web site. I can see it now, a customer responds with, "I don't remember." And what about refunds? Direct purchases can be refunded, Mac App Store purchases, well, "You'll have to talk with Apple." 

Overall, I can see the Mac App Store leading to confusion and delay.

Oh, and then there is the concern of paid upgrades. Many, if not most, desktop software vendors count on revenue earned by paid upgrades. Paid upgrades are currently not supported in the iOS App Store, so I have to think the same will be true of the Mac App Store.

And let's not forget the trial versions of the app. A customer can come to my web site and download a free 30-day trial of my software. This gives the user time to evaluate the app before making a purchasing decision. This is not going to happen, at least not initially, with the Mac App Store. Will this lead to users demanding lower prices and if so will software vendors given in starting a new race to the bottom. I certainly hope not. Software vendors need to stay their ground and price their products based on the value of the app.

Will my app be rejected from the Mac App Store if I include in the app description, "Come to my web site to download a free 30-day trial"? And what of cross-platform apps? Say I write a version of Killink CSV for the Mac. According to the list of review rules, I cannot mention the availability of the Windows version in the app's metadata. If I do, it will be rejected even if this is a key selling point of the app.

I welcome the Mac App Store. It has great potential for tapping into a customer base that otherwise would be un-tappable. But I worry the Mac App Store is not the right place for many desktop app and by not being in the Mac App Store sells will suffer. Only time will tell if the Mac App Store will help software vendors, especially the indie shops like White Peak Software, to succeed.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There is much to be concerned about with the new Mac App Store. Demos, upgrades, lack of direct customer contact,  the broken user reviews system, and especially the submission guidelines.

But, if the iOS App Store is any indication of exposure to new customers, this could be a huge boon for small developers.

I worry that Apple doesn't understand the 3rd party Mac software ecosystem, but who knows maybe they have something.  Either way, it clearly can't be ignored.

Interesting times indeed.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Isn't not like I need a distraction from work, but I couldn't resist this one. I saw a tweet about iDOS, a DOS emulator app just released for iPad and iPhone. For fear the app will be pulled from the App Store, I bought it right away. Besides, it's only 99 cent.

I read a story about someone <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2010/10/26/idos/">installing Windows 3.0 inside of iDOS</a>. Sounds cool but I'm not interested in Windows 3.0. Instead, I decided to install Turbo Pascal. Embarcadero recently posted <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20803">Turbo Pascal v5.5 as a free download</a> so the first thing I did was to grab a copy of it. Next, I grabbed an <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html#Downloads">unzip program</a> so I can unzip TP55.zip in iDOS. (Save time and <a href="ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/msdos/">go here</a> to download unz552x3.exe.)

Here are the remaining steps I followed to get Turbo Pascal up and running on my iPad.
<ul>
<li>Connect the iPad to iTunes.</li>
<li>In iTunes, go to the Apps tab for the connected iPad and scroll down to the file sharing section.</li>
<li>Drag and drop TP55.zip and unz552x3.exe to iDOS.</li>
<li>Sync the device.</li>
<li>Once sync is complete, launch iDOS on the iPad. You'll find the two files in the root directory.</li>
<li>Copy unz552x3.exe to a new directory, or just run it in the root directory. This will uncompress the unzip utility files. I prefer running it in a separate directory to keep the root clean.</li>
<li>Unzip TP55.zip. This will create two directories, DISK1 and DISK2. Again, I copied TP55.zip to a temp directory before unzip.</li>
<li>Run install.exe found in the DISK1 directory. If your experience is similar to mine, you will get a message saying to insert the oop/demos/bgi/doc diskette. I'm guessing the installer can't find the directory DISK2.</li>
<li>At this point, I aborted the install. Not to worry. Turbo Pascal's IDE, compiler, etc have been installed.</li>
<li>By default, the IDE can be found in c:\TP. The program file to run is turbo.exe.</li>
</ul>

That's it. Happy coding!

Update: If those not lucky enough to grab a copy of iDOS from the App Store, you can <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dospad/">download the source code for DOSPad</a> and build your own version.

This is awesome. Seems like UNZIP is already available with iDOS, so you can skip the unzip program.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I received an email in August from a large company. A gentleman from the company wanted to talk with me about an opportunity for White Peak Software and Labor Mate. The company wanted to rebrand Labor Mate as one of their own iOS apps. As part of the deal they would do various marketing campaigns including print ads, exposure on high traffic web sites, and announcements in email newsletters. The market efforts would potentially reach millions of people that I otherwise would not reach unless I invested large sums of my own money in my own marketing efforts.  Needless to say, I was very excited.

In exchange for the additional exposure Labor Mate would receive, I would rebrand Labor Mate to look like an app from the large company and part of the net revenue from sales would be split.  Best of all I remain owner of the app and I have final say in what goes into the app.  The deal could be looked at, in some ways, as corporate sponsorship for Labor Mate.  And I was stoked!

Over the next few months we negotiated the terms of the agreement.  At the same time, we worked on rebranding Labor Mate.  I was pleased with the final results, which was a much nicer looking Labor Mate.  And the corporate branding was done in a very tasteful, non-intrusive manner.  My only complaints, which were minor, were the desire to include a splash screen and the new look was a little too foo-foo looking for my liking.  Still, I was excited about the opportunity.

It wasn't until about a month ago that my opinions about the deal started changing from excitement to concerns.  Contract negotiations were slow and becoming much more complex.  Lawyers got involved turning a "no nonsense" agreement into a 3 year commitment with requirements for various liability insurance, errors and omissions insurance, service level agreements, and more. Assuming Labor Mate sales remain the same for first 12 months of the agreement, I would pay out roughly 25% of net revenue just in legal and insurance fees.  The deal was no longer feeling like a great opportunity.

The slow progress on contract negotiations wasn't the only thing changing my mind about the opportunity.  I starting feeling as if I would not have final say in Labor Mate's functionality.  Also, receiving visual assets from the large company was slower then I'm use to, and the extra time needed for internal approval of the app before submitting to Apple was dragging.  My concerns grew as a result.  I set aside time to work on a White Peak Software products, and I often don't have time or patience for these types of delays.  Was this something I could expect in the coming years?

As the weeks went by I was starting to feel like the once great opportunity was raising too many warning flags indicating a nightmare in the making.  Now please note, what I would call a nightmare business arrangement might be a walk in the park for others.  I'm set in my ways.  I'm an indie dev.  I work from home.  I make the decisions.  I control what I work on and when.  I have my own way of working, providing support, and determining success.  And I don't like making compromises on matters I disagree with.  Anything that changes this for me is a nightmare in the making.

I started feeling the deal would mean giving up the control and freedom I enjoy as an indie dev.  I felt I might be expected to drop everything when the large company decided changes were needed for the app.  And I would need approval from the large company on any and all changes I want to make to the app.  There was also a good amount of monthly reporting required, beyond financial reporting, that is not uncommon in Corporate America.  The deal would mean I have a bond with a large corporate business partner regarding this one app and as my past has repeatedly shown, I don't function well in Corporate America.

To make matters worse, there was no long term plan for the rebranded Labor Mate.  What happens if the agreement is terminated early?  Would that be the end of Labor Mate? Would I be required to pull it from the App Store or would I only need to remove the branding elements from the app?  Would there be pressure to support other mobile platforms?  And what if my vision for Labor Mate's future differs from the large company's vision?  What would be my options going forward with Labor Mate?  

There were too many unanswered questions for my liking.  What was once an exciting opportunity was already causing undo stress and concerns for me.  In the 3 months that past, things didn't get better.  They got worse, from my point of view.  And if that can happen in a short 3 months, what would the next 3 years be like?  My gut kept telling me it would be a 3 year nightmare.

Everyone I talked to about this deal agreed, it sounded like a great opportunity in the beginning but not so great in the end. Everyone also agreed I should walk away from the deal before it was too late.

So today I talked with my contacts at the large company.  I explained that this opportunity wasn't right for White Peak Software and that I am stepping away from the deal.  To my surprise, it came as no surprise.  I guess that means I did a good job communicating my concerns over the last couple of months.  It also might mean they recognize indie devs and Corporate America don't always mix.

I should note the individuals at the large company were friendly, understanding, and tried their best to make the deal work.  They too were feeling the stress and were annoyed with the lengthy negotiations.  In the end, though, I had to decide what's best for my company, and this deal wasn't in White Peak Software's best interest.

Despite the distractions of this deal over the last 3 months, all is not lost.  I did learn, and re-learn, some valuable lessons.
<ol>
<li>If it sounds too good to be true then it probably is.
<li>Lawyers for the other side suck because they are not looking out for your best interest.  Lawyers for your side are awesome because they are looking out for the your best interest.
<li>Talk to friends, peers, business associates and colleagues, and anyone else who will listen about any major business deal. They will often provide insight and points of view you will never think of.
<li>Don't get distracted by too good to be true opportunities that do not fit into your business plan. And don't try to make the opportunity fit into your business plan just because it sounds too good to pass up. It's either a natural fit for your business or it is not.
<li>Stand by your principles
<li>It' okay to say "No" even if no comes 3 months down the road.
<li>And lastly, if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is.
</ol>

So what's next for Labor Mate? I'm going to take the money I would have spent on extra insurance, hire a kick-ass designer, and get to work on Labor Mate 2.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great post! Glad to hear I am not the only one that has felt the nightmare business arrangement.  You made the right move my friend.  It would of been a lot easier for them and you to have left it at the original verbal agreement in written form.  When things get into the liability and control issues it gets way to complex and is truthfully not worth it to either side.  There will always be "what if's", but the truth of the matter is that they would be able to promote something, to enhance their business, that they would not have otherwise had in the first place.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I decided one of my apps should display placeholder text in a text view. Unfortunately UITextView does not have a placeholder property. I've always thought this is odd especially given the fact that UITextField has a placeholder property. 

I googled to see what others have done. I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1328638/placeholder-in-uitextview">some good approaches</a> but no one solution that I liked. So I decided to write my own borrowing from the various ideas of others. The end result is KTTextView.

<a href="https://github.com/kirbyt/KTTextView">KTTextView</a> derives from UITextView and enhances it with new features. At the moment the only new feature is the placeholder text. The <strong>placeholderText</strong> property works same as UITextField's placeholder property. I also added the property <strong>placeholderColor</strong> in case an app has the need to use a color different then the default placeholder color.

KTTextView is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/kirbyt/KTTextView">github</a>. The project includes a sample app showing how to use KTTextView. I plan to add more features as time allows. One feature I want to add is an option to display the text view in a rounded rectangle giving it a similar look to UITextField. In the meantime, I hope you find the KTTextView's current implementation useful.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://outerlevel.com/knapsack/"><img src="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Knapsack.png" alt="Knapsack" border="0" width="128" height="128" style="float:right;" /></a>I'm very excited to announce a new partnership between <a href="http://outerlevel.com/">Outer Level</a> and White Peak Software. Outer Level is the maker of great Mac and iOS apps including <a href="http://outerlevel.com/licensekeeper/">LicenseKeeper</a>, <a href="http://outerlevel.com/bullfrog-mac/">Bullfrog</a>, and (my personal favorite) <a href="http://outerlevel.com/knapsack/">Knapsack</a>. Outer Level's success over the last year has left Jon, founder and lead developer at Outer Level, with more work than he can handle by himself. So Jon has asked me to join the Outer Level development team to help out.

I'm very excited about this opportunity to work with one of the top Mac developer in the community. And while I have a lot to offer Jon and team, I will selfishly be learning a lot from Jon as I help with new development on Knapsack, Outer Level's <a href="http://outerlevel.com/knapsack/">travel app</a>.

What impact will this have on White Peak Software? None. I will continue working for White Peak Software as I have for the last 7 and a half years (Wow! It's been that long?!). This partnership will, however, reduce my availability for consulting work, but this is a good thing as it fits within my long term goals for White Peak.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Discoloration on the New iPad 2 is No Reason to Panic</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I received my shinny, new iPad 2 yesterday. When I turned it on I immediately saw yellowish discolorations along the top, right, and bottom edges. The discoloration at the top right corner is the worse and is about the size of my thumb. I tweeted about the problem to see if others have seen the same issue. A friend pointed me to <a href="http://www.theipadfan.com/ipad-2-screen/">this site</a> which describes the problem and shows a picture of the discoloration.

So apparently this is a problem with the new iPad 2, but I don't think it's a major problem. Nor do I think it's a problem with iPad 2 only. Here's why.

It seems that many iPads will show some slight discoloration when displaying an all black screen with full brightness while in the dark. I see this on my first generation iPads, so this is not a new problem with the iPad 2. And I don't see this as a major problem because under normal use you do not see the discoloration. I have used my first generation iPads (I have two of them) for nearly a year, and I have never noticed this problem. I can only see it when I display an all black screen with full brightness while in the dark, which is not a normal use case scenario.

With that said, the problem with my new iPad 2 is different. Yes, it's the same yellowish discoloration, but in my particular case the discoloration is noticeable when using the iPad under normal conditions. The discoloration is visible on my device when running apps with black backgrounds (such as Kindle and Instapaper) with the brightness set to a low level while sitting in a room with natural daytime light. This is why I have asked Apple for a replacement. I wouldn't care about the discoloration if it wasn't noticeable under normal use, but for my particular device it is noticeable under normal use.

So before you panic and think you have a defective iPad 2 because you can see some discoloration when looking at an all black screen with full brightness while in the dark, see if the discoloration is noticeable under normal conditions. I'm willing to bet your iPad is perfectly fine.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[White Peak Software suffered a major email server outage earlier today. Server hardware at the hosting provider died a horrible death causing the outage. I believe the outage started around 10:30 am Eastern and continued until almost 8:00 pm Eastern. 

After a few hours and reports of emails bouncing back with "invalid email address" errors, I decided to move the White Peak Software mail server to a new hosting provider. This meant email was once again flowing even while the original hosting provider tried to solve the hardware problems.

Email seems to be stable again. However, if you sent an email to White Peak or me any time today and I have not responded then please resend the email. It's likely the email fell into a black hole.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend was <a href="http://voicesthatmatter.com/">Voices That Matter</a> Seattle. It was my second time attending VTM and second time speaking. I have to say this latest installment of VTM was even better than the last one in Philly.</p>
<p>My conference weekend kicked off on Friday with a full day workshop learning <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">Cocos2D</a>. This workshop was full of juicy awesome goodness, and for the first time in my career I feel like I now know how to write a game. In fact I have a new game idea brewing in my head as I type this. <a href="http://twitter.com/rodstrougo">Rod Strougo</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/rwenderlich">Ray Wenderlich</a> did an outstanding job putting together and teaching the full day workshop.</p>
<p>VTM continued to impress for the next two days. Some highlights for me included:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/bmf">Mike Lee's</a> keynote. I was especially moved by the part where Mike talked about our wonderful iOS and Mac developer community.</li>
<li>Hearing <a href="http://twitter.com/zaphodgjd">Graeme Devine</a> talk on Game Center and the Art of Addictive Games and getting to meet him. We had some good chats. It wasn't until later I found out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Devine">who he really is</a>.</li>
<li>Meeting <a href="http://www.kevincallahan.org/">Kevin Callahan</a> and getting the one-on-one demo of <a href="http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html">Accessorizer</a>. This app is awesome and does so much to make you more productive in Xcode.</li>
<li>And of course catching up with old friends and making new ones (too many to list here).</li>
</ul>
Thanks to the <a href="http://twitter.com/vtm_iphone">VTM organizers</a> for putting on a great event, and special thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/chuckdude">Chuck</a> for getting me from and to the airport.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I posted a new beta for Killink CSV Editor v2 today. The big feature added to version 2 is Unicode support. This means Killink CSV Editor can now read and write not only ASCII files but UTF-8 and UTF-16 files.

If you're a Killink CSV Editor user and you want to live life on the edge, please <a href="http://cdn.whitepeaksoftware.com/downloads/setup-killinkcsv-250.exe">download beta 2</a>, give it a test drive, and send email to <em>support at white peak software dot com</em> if you encounter any issues. Note this build of Killink CSV Editor installs, by default, in a separate directory allowing both Version 1.14 and Version 2.0 to co-exists on the same computer.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>First Impressions: MacBook Pro with Retina Display</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In July 2007 I bought a fully loaded MacBook Pro. It was by far the best computer I have ever owned. And that isn't just my opinion. PC World said the Apple MacBook Pro was the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/136649-3/in_pictures_the_most_notable_notebooks_of_2007.html">fastest Windows Vista notebook</a> at the time.

My MacBook Pro was also the most expensive computer I have ever bought. The high price tag wasn't because of the perceived "Mac tax." The high price tag was due to hardware cost. In fact, I looked at what it would cost to buy the same set of hardware from Dell at the time, and Dell's price was $200 more than Apple's.

My MacBook Pro has served me well for 5 years, which is a long time especially for a laptop. But it has reached its limits. The machine, while still usable, is just too slow for the work I do daily. I might be able to squeeze out another year if I could bump up the RAM to 8 GB or even 16 GB, but sadly, that model only goes to 4 GB. (Yes, I know there is a non-Apple recommended way to bump up to 6 GB, but let's face it. Five years is a long time for a laptop.) So nearly 5 years to the date, I got myself a new MacBook Pro. (My previous MBP arrived July 25, 2007, and my latest one arrived July 30, 3012.)

It's too early to say if I will get 5 years of service out of this latest MBP, but I'm hopeful I will. And while my latest MBP is expensive, it still costed less than the one I bought in 2007 - by nearly $700 if I remember correctly. Though admittedly I did not get the maxed out MBP this time around. I got the 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 with 16 GB RAM, 512 GB flash storage, and retina display.

My first impression of the new MacBook Pro: It's a sweet machine. 

It feels heavier than I expected, but it's still lighter than my 2007 MBP. It's super quiet especially compared to my 2007 MBP. My 2007 MBP's fan runs non-stop when attached to the power cord. This started when I updated to Lion and has annoyed me ever since. (Thankfully my Bose noise canceling headphones drown out the fan noise from my old MBP.) And my new MBP doesn't heat up like my old one does.

My new MBP is fast, really fast compared to my 2007 MBP. This is most noticeable for me when compiling projects in Xcode. A project that would take a minute and a half to do a clean compile now takes 10 seconds. And iPhoto, with my 40 GB library, is once again useable. iPhoto was so painfully slow on my other MBP that I only used it to import photos and that was it. But last night I was tagging faces, looking at photos from places, and doing some minor cropping and editing on my shinny, new MBP.

While I knew the new MBP would be faster, lighter, and better than my previous MBP, the one feature I was lukewarm on is the retina display. If the non-retina MBP supported 16 GB of RAM then I might have bought one of them instead of the retina MBP. However, after using my new MBP for a day, I so glad I went with the retina display. Text on the new retina display is crisp, clear, and much more readable than on the non-retina display. And as someone who has to stare at text all day, this was a welcome surprise for me. I was indifferent about the retina display before buying my MBP, but now, I can't imaging buy a new MBP without the retina display.

The retina display also provides one additional benefit for me. I'm currently working on the second addition of my book <a href="http://amzn.to/ipadprogbook">Learning iPad Programming</a>. My publisher prefers screenshots for figure images to be at 150 ppi minimum, but normal computer displays are only 72 ppi. With the new retina display, I can take screenshots that are 144 ppi. Still not quite 150 ppi, but a lot closer, which should make my publisher happier.

So after only a day of playing on the new MBP with retina display, was the purchase worth well for me? Absolutely. There's no doubt in my mind that going with the MBP with retina display was the right choice for me. That said, if my previous MBP were only a year or so old, I might have held off on the purchase until the price drops a bit. But for me, at this time, the new MBP with retina display is the idea machine for me. The 16 GB of RAM, faster CPU and flash storage, and of course the retina display are vast improvements needed for my daily work.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For more than 10 years my primary dev machines have been laptops. The mobility provided by a laptop has changed the way, and where, I work. However an unfortunate downside of me using a laptop as my primary machine are the number of batteries I go through. On average a laptop battery will last me about a year before I need to order a replacement. It's common for battery life to degrade some after a year, but for me it's common for me to see "Service Battery" around the 1-year mark.

Why do I burn through so many laptop batteries? It's the way I use my laptop. 

I often times treat my laptop as a desktop leaving it plugged into power for days, and sometimes even weeks at a time. But laptops are not designed for this kind of usage. The battery, like a muscle in your body, needs to be exercised. For a lithium-ion battery - found in most if not all laptops today - this means <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_7259005_condition-laptop-battery.html">conditioning the battery</a>. 

To condition a battery, you run your laptop on battery power regularly using a portion of the battery's power then charge the battery as often as possible before waiting for the battery to fully discharge. After about 30 charge cycles you want to do a full discharge of the battery followed by a full recharge. 

Whew! That's a lot of work to exercise a laptop battery. Well okay, it's not a lot of work, but it does require some discipline. And history has proven that I don't have the discipline to properly condition my laptop's battery.

So now I'm faced with a dilemma. I have a shinny, new MacBook Pro that doesn't have a swappable battery. The battery can be replaced, but it must be replaced by Apple. I can't simply buy a replacement battery online and pop it in when I need it. So I'm trying to change my ways to prolong the battery life for my new MacBook Pro, and I'm using <a href="http://fruitjuiceapp.com">FruitJuice</a> to help me along the way.

<a href="http://fruitjuiceapp.com">FruitJuice</a> is a combination Mac app and web service that helps extend the life of your laptop's battery by guiding you through the battery conditioning steps. It works by not only reminding you to condition your battery, it steps you through the conditioning process with convention and helpful email and SMS notifications. And when you are between conditioning periods you can use FruitJuice to see how well you are exercising your battery by alternating between running on battery power and charging the battery.

<a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/FruitJuice.png"><img src="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/FruitJuice.png" alt="FruitJuice" border="0" width="360" /></a>

It's this last feature that I like the most. I find myself checking my plugged in percentage a few times a day to make sure I stay in the green zone.  The green zone is the ideal combination of running on battery power and plugged into a power source.

<a href="http://fruitjuiceapp.com">FruitJuice</a> comes with a free 30-day trial, and cost $9.99 per year for one computer. Each additional computer costs $4.99 per year. This is cheap when you compare it to the cost of a new battery, which costs $129 for the MacBook Pro.

So is FruitJuice saving me money? It's too early to tell since my MacBook Pro is only 2 weeks old, and I've been using FruitJuice just as long. But I'm hopeful that a year from now I will not see the dreaded "Service Battery" condition that I've seen over and over the past few years. ]]></content:encoded>
